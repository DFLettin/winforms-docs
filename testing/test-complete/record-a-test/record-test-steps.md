8\.	After clicking **Finish** button the current **RadGridView** region will be stored as an image that will be used for comparison every time when the test runs.

9\.	Click **Add Check** button again but this time select **Table or Grid** option in the Checkpoint Wizard. Drag the target button over the **RadGridView** once again in order for TestComplete to scan the **RadGridView** data table and store all of its information in order to verify that data is as expected next time when you run the test.

10\. Click TestComplete **Stop** button in order to stop your recording and create your test.

Running your test will perform all of the steps described so far. After performing the filtering operation, it will validate if **RadGridView** region is the same as the expected image and also it will check if the Table information is correct.
