# Overview

TestComplete recognizes [**Telerik Controls**](https://support.smartbear.com/testcomplete/docs/general-info/supported-technologies/controls/telerik.html#supported-classes) and Custom Controls. 

We will show you how to create **TestComplete** tests both **manually** and by **recording** them. 

**Recording** enables you to create tests easily. You can perform some actions against the tested application once, and **TestComplete** will automatically recognize these actions, and then convert them to script lines or keyword test operations. You create a test visually, and, in one sense, you record the performed actions to a script or keyword test. This approach does not require much experience in creating tests.

In order to create tests **manually**, you need to enter all the needed commands and actions via script objects or keyword test commands. This approach is helpful when you need to create very powerful and flexible tests or if you have good experience in creating tests. However, creating tests manually requires a lot of time and does not prevent you from various problems. For example, you must know the classes and names of your application objects you want to work with.
