## Word-Inspired Template

The __Word-Inspired Template__ implements Word-like editing experience represented with the __Telerik UI for WinForms__ controls. It provides a complex integration of controls like __RichTextEditorRibbonBar__, __RadRichTextEditor__ in an already set up example. It also demonstrates the broad range of editing and formatting capabilities as well as built in specific features of these controls.
