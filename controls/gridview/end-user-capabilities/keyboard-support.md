# Keyboard Support

A typical business application needs to support "heads-down" data entry that avoids the use of the mouse. With RadGridView the user can:

* Navigate the grid using only the arrow keys.

* Edit rows using the __F2__ or __Enter__ keys, depending on the __BeginEditMode__ value.

|| __Key__ | __Description__ |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
||Up Arrow|moves the selection up|
||Down Arrow|moves the selection down|
||Left Arrow|moves the selection left|
||Right Arrow|moves the selection right|
||Enter|Opens the cell editor / Commits the changes|
||F2|Opens the cell editor|
||Esc|Deactivates cellÂ editor and discards the changes|
