# Touch Support

RadGridView supports the following functionalities via touch interface:

## Scrolling

To scroll the control simply drag the whole control to the desired location (left, right, up, down).

Here is the result of scrolling the control down:

## Grouping

To group the grid according to some column, just drag the desired column title to the "*Drag a column here to group by this column*" section above the header area.

And the grid is grouped:

## Column Resize

Resizing the columns is achieved by the zoom gesture applied to the desired column title.
