# Binding to Sub Objects

RadGridView supports out-of-the-box binding to sub objects by intuitive and simple __dot (.)__ syntax (specified through the __FieldName__ property of declaratively bound columns). The example below includes a "Person" class that has three properties, one of which is a reference type "Car":

* Name - string

* City - string

* Car - object Car

Follows the implementation of the Person and the Car classes:

Lets populate a `BindingList` of `Person` with some objects and bind it to RadGridView.

Binding RadGridView to `Person` automatically creates three columns for all properties of the `Person` object. The value properties are displayed correctly, but the reference property is displayed in "dot" notation (see the third (Car) column in the screenshot below).

{{source=..\SamplesCS\GridView\PopulatingWithData\BindingToSubObjects.cs region=bind radgridview}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\GridView\PopulatingWithData\BindingToSubObjects.vb region=bind radgridview}} 

````C#
BindingList<Person> list = new BindingList<Person>();
list.Add(new Person("Jessy Jones", "New York", new Car("BMW", 2011)));
list.Add(new Person("Allan Trenton", "Las Vegas", new Car("Mercedes", 2011)));
list.Add(new Person("Brandon Michels", "Los Angeles", new Car("Lexus", 2010)));
list.Add(new Person("Michael Jordan", "Chicago", new Car("Toyota", 2009)));
list.Add(new Person("Dimitar Berbatov", "Manchester", new Car("Infinity", 2008)));
radGridView1.DataSource = list;

````
````VB.NET
Dim list As New BindingList(Of Person)
list.Add(New Person("Jessy Jones", "New York", New Car("BMW", 2011)))
list.Add(New Person("Allan Trenton", "Las Vegas", New Car("Mercedes", 2011)))
list.Add(New Person("Brandon Michels", "Los Angeles", New Car("Lexus", 2010)))
list.Add(New Person("Michael Jordan", "Chicago", New Car("Toyota", 2009)))
list.Add(New Person("Dimitar Berbatov", "Manchester", New Car("Infinity", 2008)))
RadGridView1.DataSource = list

Now to setup the sub-property binding of the `Car` column, all you have to do is to declare in the __FieldName__ property of the column, the name of the Car object property that you want to bind the column to (Model or Year), using the __dot__ notation:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\GridView\PopulatingWithData\BindingToSubObjects.cs region=add sub property binding}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\GridView\PopulatingWithData\BindingToSubObjects.vb region=add sub property binding}} 

````C#
radGridView1.Columns[2].FieldName = "Car.Model";

````
````VB.NET
RadGridView1.Columns(2).FieldName = "Car.Model"

````

{{endregion}} 

The result is that the `Car` column is now bound to the __Model__ property of the `Car` object
