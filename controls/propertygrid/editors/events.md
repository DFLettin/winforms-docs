# Events

The following events occur during the editing process:

* __EditorRequired__: This is the first event that fires when a cell is to become editable (in edit mode).

>note This is the right place to replace the editor with a custom one. [Here](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/controls/propertygrid/editors/using-custom-editor) is an example of this behavior.
>

* __Editing__: Fires when the item is about to enter edit mode. You can cancel edit mode at this stage by setting the __Cancel__ property to *true*.

* __EditorInitialized__: Fires when the editor is initialized and visible.

* __Edited__: Fires when the item editing has finished.

* __ValueChanging__: The active editor fires this event when it is about to change its value.

* __ValueChanged__: Fires when the active editor changes its value. The data is not saved in the item at this point.

* __PropertyValueChanging__: The item fires this event when it is about to save the value. 

* __PropertyValueChanged__: Fires when the value has been saved to the item.

There are more events fired during this process. Please look in the  [Data validation]({%slug winforms/propertygrid/editors/validation%}) section.
