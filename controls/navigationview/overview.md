# RadNavigationView

As of **R2 2022 SP1** Telerik UI for WinForms suite offers a standalone **RadNavigationView** control. It provides a collapsible navigation pane that helps implement the hamburger menu pattern and automatically adapts the pane's display mode to different control sizes. The idea of the control is to be a top-level container and to contain all the controls and views that would be typically placed on a form. The menu pane is for navigation between different views and is not meant to contain actions.

>note RadNavigationView actually represents a [RadPageView]({%slug winforms/pageview%}) with already applied ViewMode to [NavigationView]({%slug winforms/pageview/navigationview%}).
