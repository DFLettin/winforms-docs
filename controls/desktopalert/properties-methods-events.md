# Methods

|Method|Description|
|----|----|
|__Show__|Displays the alert pop up on the screen at the specified location.|
|__Hide__|Hides the alert pop up from the screen.|
|__ResetLocationModifier__|Resets the explicit location modifier. In other words, if the user has modified the location of the alert's pop up, the __DesktopAlertManager__ will not consider it when rearranging the visible alerts. This method will reset the explicit location modifier and thus the __DesktopAlertManager__ will continue managing the location of the alert according to its location settings.|

|__Closing__|Fires when the alert's pop up is about to be closed. The closing action can be canceled by modifying the arguments of this event.|
