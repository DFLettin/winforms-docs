# Design Time

__RadDataLayout__ control hosts a __RadLayoutControl__ allowing the user to build complex layouts at design-time as well as at run-time. Information on how __RadLayoutControl__ can be customized in the designer is available here: [RadLayoutControl Design Time]({%slug winforms/layoutcontrol/design-time%})

## Smart Tag

The smart tag allows you to open the layout editor, change the theme and open the on-line resources. You can dock the control in its parent container as well. The following section describes the layout editor.

## Design Time Data Binding

For the purpose of this example we will bind our data layout control to the **Cars** table of the Northwind database. After specifying the data source, the control will build the editors according to the properties of the data bound object.

## Layout Editor

This editor allows us to rearrange the generated editors. Additional elements can be dragged from the __Items__ tab in the layout panel. You can hide existing items with the default context menu as well. The __Structure__ tab shows the current layout structure and allows easier item selection. You can start drag and drop operation from this tab to the layout panel.

## Selection Glyph

The selection glyph is an arrow that is shown when a control in the layout panel is selected. It allows you to select the underlying host item and change its properties at design time.
