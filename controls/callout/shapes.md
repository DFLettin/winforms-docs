# Shapes 

**RadCallout** supports the following predefined shapes. The **CalloutType** property controls what shape will be applied:

* **CalloutType.Rectangle**:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Callout\CalloutSettings.cs region=Rectangle}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Callout\CalloutSettings.vb region=Rectangle}} 

````C#

  this.radCallout1.CalloutType = Telerik.WinControls.UI.Callout.CalloutType.Rectangle;

````
````VB.NET
   Me.RadCallout1.CalloutType = Callout.CalloutType.Rectangle

````

* **CalloutType.RoundedRectangle**:

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Callout\CalloutSettings.vb region=RoundedRectangle}}

````
````VB.NET
	Me.RadCallout1.CalloutType = Callout.CalloutType.RoundedRectangle

All predefined callout shapes are defined as a **CalloutElementShape** which is a derivative of PathElementShape. 
 
## Custom Shapes

The CalloutForm.**Shape** property allows setting any [ElementShape]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/shapes%}) that you may have.

>important When a custom shape, that is not a derivative of **CalloutElementShape** is set, no arrow will be rendered to the callout form due to the specifics of the WinForms graphics paths' rendering. It is up to the developer to include the arrow to the custom ElementShape.

>note When a custom shape is applied, most of the arrow and shape property settings may not be respected since the developer will be responsible for the complete rendering of the callout.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to apply one of the predefined [ElementShapes]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/shapes%}) that the Telerik Presentation Framework offers.

#### Custom Predefined Shape

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Callout\CalloutSettings.cs region=PredefinedCustomShape}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Callout\CalloutSettings.vb region=PredefinedCustomShape}} 

````C#

 this.radCallout1.CalloutForm.Shape = new DiamondShape();          

````
````VB.NET

Me.RadCallout1.CalloutForm.Shape = New DiamondShape()

````

Since the default callout shapes are defined as **CalloutElementShape**, you can create a derivative of the **PathElementShape** class and override 
the **CreatePath(Rectangle bounds)** method. Thus, you can construct any custom shape that you need. The following two examples demonstrate how to create a Cloud and Kaboom shapes for RadCallout.
