# WinForms Buttons Overview

__RadButton__ is a [themable] ({%slug winforms/buttons/button/customizing-appearance/themes%}) replacement of the standard WinForms Button. It can be clicked by using the mouse, *Enter* key, or *Spacebar*, if the button has focus. You can also use [Smart Tags]({%slug winforms/buttons/button/design-time%}), set [Properties]({%slug winforms/buttons/button/properties,methods, events%}), [Customize its Appearance]({%slug winforms/buttons/button/customizing-appearance/accessing-and-customizing-elements%}) and assign [Tooltips]({%slug winforms/buttons/button/tooltips%}).
