# SplitButton

__RadSplitButton__ provides a menu-like interface contained within a button that can be placed anywhere on a form.

Each of the items on the __RadSplitButton__ can be set to perform an action when clicked. In addition, the items can contain other items, allowing you to create any hierarchy that fits your needs. Like a standard button, you control the displayed text by setting the __Text__ property. Unlike a standard button, __RadSplitButton__ displays drop-down items when clicked, so handling the __Click__ event is not appropriate. Instead, work directly with the events of the items. To learn how to create and use items see [Gettied Started with Telerik RadSplitButton Items]({%slug winforms/buttons/splitbutton/working-with-radsplitbutton-items%}).

__RadSplitButton__ is visually indistinguishable from [RadDropDownButton]({%slug winforms/buttons/dropdownbutton%}), but there is an important programmatic distinction. On __RadSplitButton__ you set a __DefaultItem__ property to indicate the item whose __Click__ event should be triggered when the button is clicked. The functionality of __RadSplitButton__ is "split" between the button itself and the dropdown menu.
