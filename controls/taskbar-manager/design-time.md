The **RadToastNotifications Editor** is divided in 3 main sections. On the left side, you can see all added toast notifications. In the middle section there is a RadSyntaxEditor showing the syntax for the selected toast notification template. On the right side, you have the possibilities to customize the loaded toast notification and add different types of elements and toast attributes to them.

The **Preview** button is quite useful for showing the particular toast notification while you are still designing it. The **OK**/**Cancel** buttons confirms/discard the changes respectively.
