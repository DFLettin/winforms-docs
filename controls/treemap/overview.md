# WinForms TreeMap Overview

**RadTreeMap** is a data visualization control used to display hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles. Each rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension on the data. It is useful in scenarios where a lot of items have to be compared in a limited space. When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure, you can easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways.

## Key Features:

* **Different tiling algorithms**: The control support two tiling algorithms to visualize the data - **Squarified** and **Slice and Dice**. The default one is Squarified.

* **Colorizers**: The colorizers allow you to choose different colors for the different tiles in the control. 

* **Selection**: The control supports selection functionality that allows you to highlight items upon click or setting a property. 

* **Data binding support**: The RadTreeMap control can be bound to a hierarchical collection which will be visualized in a tree-like layout. 

* **Automatic items ordering**: The layout orientation (vertical or horizontal) will be chosen automatically - by calculating the available space for the given data. When horizontal orientation is applied - the child tiles are going to be stacked horizontally. Respectively vertical orientation will make the child tiles to be stacked vertically.
