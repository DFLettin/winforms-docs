# Using the Keyboard

The PageViewMode.*ExplorerBar* supports keyboard navigation with the arrow keys on the keyboard. If the stack position is adjusted to be *Top*, the Up/Down arrows select the previous/next item in the stack, whereas the Left/Right collapse/expand the currently selected item. On the contrary, if the stack position is chosen to be *Left*, the Left/Right keys on the keyboard select the previous/next item, whereas the Up/Down keys expand/collapse the currently selected item.
