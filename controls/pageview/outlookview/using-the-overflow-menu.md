# Using the Overflow Menu

## Basics

The Overflow Menu of the **RadPageView**’s PageViewMode.*Outlook* allows for permanently hiding/showing items from the stack. In other words, the user can define whether an item will be available in the stack or not. If an item is permanently hidden from the stack, it cannot be selected from the UI unless shown again from the Overflow Menu. To hide (uncheck) an item, show the overflow menu and show the drop-down of the *Add or Remove Buttons* item. You will see a list of all currently available items in the Outlook View. By clicking on an item, you will toggle its checked/unchecked state to the opposite one.

## Programming the Overflow Menu

As well as from the UI, you can check/uncheck items by using the **RadPageViewOutlookElement**’s API. To do so, you should use the **ViewElement** property of the **RadPageView**, cast it to the **RadPageViewOutlookElement** type and call the corresponding API methods as shown in the code snippet below:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PageView\OutlookView.cs region=programmingOverflow}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PageView\OutlookView.vb region=programmingGrip}} 

````C#
RadPageViewOutlookElement outlookElement = this.radPageView1.ViewElement as RadPageViewOutlookElement;
//Hide the first item
outlookElement.UncheckItem(this.radPageViewPage1.Item as RadPageViewOutlookItem);
//Show the first item again
outlookElement.CheckItem(this.radPageViewPage1.Item as RadPageViewOutlookItem);

````
````VB.NET
Dim outlookElement As RadPageViewOutlookElement = TryCast(Me.radPageView1.ViewElement, RadPageViewOutlookElement)
'Drags the sizing grip one item down.
outlookElement.DragGripDown()
'Drags the sizing grip one item up.
outlookElement.DragGripUp()

````

{{endregion}} 

>note The **CheckItem**/**UncheckItem** methods accept an instance of the **RadPageViewOutlookItem** class. Since the **Item** property of the **RadPageViewPage** class is of the **RadPageViewItem** type, you should cast the returned result to the required type.
>

## Using the Overflow Menu’s Events

The **RadPageViewOutlookElement** class exposes the following events to notify the user of an action triggered by using the Overflow Menu:

* **ItemChecked**

* **ItemUnchecked**

The **ItemChecked** event is fired each time an item is put back in the Outlook View’s stack either by calling the **CheckItem** method or using the UI. The **ItemUnchecked** event is fired each time an item is permanently hidden from the Outlook View’s stack either by calling the **UncheckItem** method or using the UI.
