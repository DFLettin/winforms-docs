# Overview 

The navigation view control provides a collapsible navigation pane that helps implement the __hamburger menu__ pattern and automatically adapts the pane's display mode to different control sizes. The idea of the control is to be a top-level container and to contain all the controls and views that would be typically placed on a form. The menu pane is for navigation between different views and is not meant to contain actions.
