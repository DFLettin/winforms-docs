# Subscribing to RadPageViewPage Events

Subscribing to **RadPageViewPage**'s event is no different then subscribing to any other event. Following is an example code snippet:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PageView\HowTo.cs region=subscribeToEvents}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PageView\HowTo.vb region=subscribeToEvents}}

````C#
            
radPageViewPage1.MouseClick += new MouseEventHandler(radPageViewPage1_MouseClick);
radPageViewPage1.MouseDoubleClick += new MouseEventHandler(radPageViewPage1_MouseDoubleClick);

````
````VB.NET
AddHandler radPageViewPage1.MouseClick, AddressOf radPageViewPage1_MouseClick
AddHandler radPageViewPage1.MouseDoubleClick, AddressOf radPageViewPage1_MouseDoubleClick

````

{{endregion}} 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PageView\HowTo.cs region=eventHandlers}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PageView\HowTo.vb region=eventHandlers}} 

````C#
 
void radPageViewPage1_MouseDoubleClick(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    //do something
}
void radPageViewPage1_MouseClick(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    //do something
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub radPageViewPage1_MouseDoubleClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs)
    'do something
End Sub
Private Sub radPageViewPage1_MouseClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs)
    'do something
End Sub
