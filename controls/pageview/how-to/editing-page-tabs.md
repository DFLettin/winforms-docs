# Editing page tabs

By default, __RadPageView__ does not allow modifying of the current page tab's text. If the __AllowEdit__ property of the **ViewElement** is set to *true*, the user may select a page item and press `F2` to initiate editing. Double click also enables editing. By default, a text editor is invoked and allows the editing of the page tab's text. If the user cancels editing by pressing `Escape`, the value is not persisted. Editing can also be initiated and cancelled programmatically.

* Use the __BeginEdit()__ method to initiate editing on the selected page tab.

* Use the __EndEdit()__ method to commit any changes and ends the edit operation. 

* Use the __CancelEdit()__ method to close the currently active editor and discard the changes.

The sample code below demonstrates how to start editing:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PageView\EditingRadPageViewElement\EditingRadPageViewElement.cs region=EnableEditing}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PageView\EditingRadPageViewElement\EditingRadPageViewElement.vb region=EnableEditing}} 

````C#
radPageView1.ViewElement.AllowEdit = true;
// set the SelectedPage - this page tab will be edited  
radPageView1.SelectedPage = radPageView1.Pages[1];
// this will start edit operation on the selected page tab
radPageView1.ViewElement.BeginEdit();

````
````VB.NET
RadPageView1.ViewElement.AllowEdit = True
'set the SelectedPage - this page tab will be edited 
RadPageView1.SelectedPage = RadPageView1.Pages(1)
'this will start edit operation on the selected page tab
RadPageView1.ViewElement.BeginEdit()

## The Editing Process and Events

* A page that is being displayed by the __RadPageView__ is selected and the user presses the `F2` key to bring the page tab into edit mode.

* __RadPageView__ calls the __BeginEdit()__ method and a new editor instance is initialized. It is available publicly through the **ActiveEditor** property of the RadPageView.__ViewElement__ and it is associated with the page tab that is about to be edited.  

* A text box based editor appears for input.

* The editor triggers its __ValueChanging__ event when the editor’s value is being changed. This is a cancelable event, which can prevent editor’s value changing in some cases.

* The editor instance performs the action it has defined for the `Enter` key. Typically this indicates that edit mode should be exited and any changes made during the edit session should be applied to the page tab's text.

* The __ActiveEditor__ fires the __Validating__ event which allows the user to hook up custom logic for verification. If the __Validating__ event does not succeed (e.Cancel is *true*), the __ValidationError__ event is fired to notify all listeners that the validation has failed.

* __RadPageView__ sets the page label's text to the string representation of the editor's __Value__ property in case of successful validation.

The sample code below demonstrates how to forbid the user to clear the text in the page tab when pressing `Enter`:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PageView\EditingRadPageViewElement\EditingRadPageViewElement.cs region=Edit}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PageView\EditingRadPageViewElement\EditingRadPageViewElement.vb region=Edit}} 

````C#
radPageView1.ViewElement.AllowEdit = true;
radPageView1.ViewElement.EditorInitialized += ViewElement_EditorInitialized;

RadPageView1.ViewElement.AllowEdit = True
AddHandler RadPageView1.ViewElement.EditorInitialized, AddressOf ViewElement_EditorInitialized
