# Spline Areas



## 

The new Spline Area Charts take the Spline chart a step further.  Like the Spline, the Spline Area takes a limited set of known data points and interpolates the intervening values.  Then the area defined by the spline curve is filled in.  You define one or more series of chart items, set the chart type to __SplineArea, SplineStackedArea or StackedSplineArea100__ and RadChart does the rest.  

You can see how the same data is presented using the new chart types. __SplineArea__ displays from the back to the front, starting with the first series.  __StackedSplineArea__ adds each area to the next without covering previous areas. __StackedSplineArea100__ shows each area as a percentage contributing to the whole of a category.
