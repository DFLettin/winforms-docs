# Area Charts



## 

The Area chart consists of a series of data points joined by a line and where the area below the line is filled. Area charts are appropriate for visualizing data that fluctuates over a period of time and can be useful for emphasizing trends.  Note: Values that don't vary too wildly work best for area charts. 

Area charts display series in the order they are added, back-to-front.  Depending on the __Skin__ used, RadChart can automatically differentiate each series by displaying it in a different color. The appearance for each series can also be modified directly.

To create a Vertical Area Chart set the __SeriesOrientation__ property to __Vertical__. Set the RadChart __DefaultType__ property or __ChartSeries.Type__ to __Area__.
