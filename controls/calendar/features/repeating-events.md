# Repeating Events


A __RadCalendarDay__ object can be configured as a repeating event by setting the __Recurring__ property to one of the following __RecurringEvents__ enumeration values.

* __DayInMonth__ - Only the day part of the date is taken into account. That gives the ability to serve events repeated every month on the same day.
            

* __DayAndMonth__ - The month and the day part of the date are taken into account. That gives the ability to serve events repeated in specific month on the same day.
            

* __Week__ - The week day is taken into account. That gives the ability to serve events repeated in a specific day of the week.
            

* __WeekAndMonth__ - The week day and the month are taken into account. That gives the ability to serve events repeated in a specific week day in a specific month.
            

* __Today__ - Gives the ability to control the visual appearance of today's day.
            

* __None__ - Default value - means that the day inÂ question is a single point event, no recurrence.
            

The example below creates a __RadCalendarDay__ and assigns the __Date__. The __Recurring__ value of __DayInMonth__ causes the day to show for the 5th of every month.
