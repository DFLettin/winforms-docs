# Telerik CAB Enabling Kit


The [Telerik CAB Enabling Kit for WinForms](http://telerikcab.codeplex.com/) is part of the [Telerik UI for WinForms suite](http://www.telerik.com/products/winforms.aspx) since the R1 2008 release.  It provides seamless integration of Telerik UI for WinForms with the Composite UI Application Block (CAB). It is well suited for enterprise applications, and helps developers with using the best practices and patterns.
  
The Telerik CAB Enabling Kit (TCEK) for WinForms can be used to develop smart-client line-of-business applications such as OLTP (online transaction processing) front ends for data entry applications; rich client portals to back-end services like government or bank teller applications; UI-intensive stand-alone applications such as those used by call center staff, IT support desks or stock traders.

## Composite UI Application Block Framework

The Composite UI Application Block (CAB) framework is intended for large WinForms-based applications. The three major goals of CAB design are:
        

* __Modularity__ - you can implement business logic, visual __SmartParts__,  infrastructure components, presenter or controller components, and any other objects the application requires, in separate modules.
            

* __Productivity__ - Developer productivity increases  because each developer (or team) is able to concentrate on a specific task. The use of consistent user interfaces increases end-user productivity in applications built using Composite UI Application Block, reducing the end-user training requirements when releasing a new application.
            

* __Extensibility__ - the design of the Composite UI Application Block promotes extensibility in many different ways
