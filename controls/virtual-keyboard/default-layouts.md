## Customizing default layouts

**RadVirtualKeyboard** arranges its keys in logical layouts which control the specific position for each key. Before proceeding further, it is recommended to get yourself familiar with the [Structure]({%slug winforms-virtual-keyboard-structure%}) and [Logical Keyboard Layout]({%slug logical-keyboard-layout%}) of the virtual keyboard. 

The following code snippet demonstrates how to add a **Z** button in the *Home* layout when using KeyboardLayoutType.*Extended*:

#### Adding a key to the default Home layout

{{source=..\SamplesCS\VirtualKeyboard\KeyboardGettingStarted.cs region=AddKeyToHome}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\VirtualKeyboard\KeyboardGettingStarted.vb region=AddKeyToHome}}

````C#
radVirtualKeyboard1.LayoutType = Telerik.WinControls.VirtualKeyboard.KeyboardLayoutType.Extended;
ExtendedVirtualKeyboardLayoutPanel extendedLayoutPanel = radVirtualKeyboard1.MainLayoutPanel as ExtendedVirtualKeyboardLayoutPanel;
int keysRowIndex = 2;
int keyColSpan = 3;
int KeyRowSpan = 1;
extendedLayoutPanel.HomeButtonsLayout.Rows[keysRowIndex].Keys.Add(new Key((int)Keys.Z, KeyType.Normal, keyColSpan, KeyRowSpan));
extendedLayoutPanel.ResetLayout();

````
````VB.NET
Me.radVirtualKeyboard1.LayoutType = Telerik.WinControls.VirtualKeyboard.KeyboardLayoutType.Extended
Dim extendedLayoutPanel As ExtendedVirtualKeyboardLayoutPanel = TryCast(radVirtualKeyboard1.MainLayoutPanel, ExtendedVirtualKeyboardLayoutPanel)
Dim keysRowIndex As Integer = 2
Dim keyColSpan As Integer = 3
Dim KeyRowSpan As Integer = 1
extendedLayoutPanel.HomeButtonsLayout.Rows(keysRowIndex).Keys.Add(New Key(CInt(Keys.Z), KeyType.Normal, keyColSpan, KeyRowSpan))
extendedLayoutPanel.ResetLayout()
