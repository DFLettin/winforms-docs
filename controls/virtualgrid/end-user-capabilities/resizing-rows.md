# Resizing Rows

__RadVirtualGrid__ exposes an API allowing resizing of its rows. In order to utilize it we need to set the __AllowRowResize__ property to *true*.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\VirtualGrid\Rows\VirtualGridResizingRows.cs region=AllowRowResize}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\VirtualGrid\Rows\VirtualGridResizingRows.vb region=AllowRowResize}}
````C#
this.radVirtualGrid1.AllowRowResize = true;

````
````VB.NET
Me.RadVirtualGrid1.AllowRowResize = True

```` 



{{endregion}}

The grid rows can be resized by end users simply by positioning the mouse over the horizontal grid line and dragging it to a desired size.
