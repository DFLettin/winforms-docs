# Filtering

## Single Column Filtering

When filtering is enabled, each column displays a filter box beneath the corresponding header. The user can click the filter icon to display a drop-down list of comparison criteria (e.g. "Starts with", "Equals"...). The user can click in the textbox next to the filter button to enter a comparison value. When the user presses __Enter__ (or moves the focus off the comparison value textbox), only records that match the criteria are listed in the grid. Some criteria comparisons from the drop down list do not require a comparison value, i.e. __Is empty, Is not empty, Is null, Is not null__.
