# UI Virtualization

__RadVirtualGrid__ uses virtualization for its cells and rows. Since not all data row objects can be visible at the same time, a visual elements (which are large objects) are created only for the currently visible rows/cells in the __RadVirtualGrid__. These visual elements are reused during scrolling, filtering and other operations with the grid, meaning dramatically improved performance and memory footprint as only a small number of visual items are created.

Because of the virtualization you cannot access UI elements at design time or directly by using the Element tree or a property. Instead, you have to use formatting events. These events in __RadVirtualGrid__ are __CellFormatting__ for all cells and __RowFormatting__ for all rows. Detailed information about these events can be found in the following articles:
