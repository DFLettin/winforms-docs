# Menu Merge in MDI applications

__RadMenu__ automatically discovers that it is placed in a child MDI form. When a child MDI formÂ is maximized, **RadMenu** automatically merges the Menu items in the parent form using the **MergeType** and **MergeOrder** properties defined for each **RadMenuItem**. When a child form is restored/minimized, the parent menu state is restored.

Please refer to the next [section]({%slug winforms/menus/menu/menu-merge/menu-merge%}) about **MergeType** and **MergeOrder** properties.
