# Smart Tag
 
The *Smart Tag* for **RadMenu** lets you quickly access common tasks involved with building menus and customizing appearance through themes.

* __New Theme Manager__: Adds a new __RadThemeManager__ component to the form.

* __Edit UI elements__: Opens a dialog that displays the __Element Hierarchy Editor__. This editor lets you browse all the elements in the control, including the **RadMenu** itself and the UI elements that make up each menu item.

* __Theme Name__: Select a theme name from the drop down list of themes available for that control. Selecting a theme allows you to change all aspects of the controls visual style at one time.

* __Edit Items__: Opens the *RadItem Collection Editor*

* __Learning Center__: Navigate to the Telerik help, code library projects or support forum.

* __Search__: Search the Telerik site for a given string.

Each individual __RadMenuItem__ within the **RadMenu** also has a *Smart Tag*. Use this *Smart Tag* to quickly toggle the __AutoSize__ property, set the __Text__ property, set the **Image** property and to display the __Element Hierarchy Editor__ for the selected **RadMenuItem*8.
