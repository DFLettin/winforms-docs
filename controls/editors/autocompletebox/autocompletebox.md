# WinForms AutoCompleteBox Overview

__RadAutoCompleteBox__ allows the end-user to easily fill-in text thanks to auto-complete functionality and tokens of text. This behavior is similar to the "To" field of Outlook and Facebook where you are filling-in the recipients to which you are going to send a message:

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}
