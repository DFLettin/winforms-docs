# Element Structure and Document Object Model

The document object model of __RadAutoCompleteBox__ is represented by the __LineInfo__ class and the __ITextBlock__ interface. The __LineInfo__ class contains logical information about the start and end block of the line and its size. The __ITextBlock__ interface exposes layout information of single word. Notice that the elements which implement __ITextBlock__ interface should be inheritors of RadElement.
        

## RadTextBoxControlElement

The visual element structure of the RadTextBoxControlElement is presented on the following diagram:

* __TextBoxViewElement__ represents a viewport that is responsible for the layout and arrangement of all text blocks. It executes layout algorithms for single, multi-line and word wrap layout. It inherits from __ITextBlock__.
		  	

* __TokenizedTextBlockElement__ – represented a tokenized set of words determined by the RadAutoCompleteBox’s delimiter.
		  

* __TextBlockElement__ represents a single word, which is rendered on the viewport.

Depending on how the content of the editor is changed, one or more instances of __ITextBlock__ can be merged into a single instance. Notice that TextBlockElement cannot be merged with TokenizedTextBlockElement.
