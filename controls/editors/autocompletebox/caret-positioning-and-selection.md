# Caret positioning and selection

The positioning and selection in __RadAutoCompleteBox__ can be performed programmatically as well as by using the keyboard and mouse input.

To select items with the press the arrow keys while holding `Shift`.

Programmatic selection can be performed by using the __SelectionStart__ and __SelectionLength__ properties.

The __SelectionStart__ property is an integer that indicates the insertion point within the string of text, with 0 being the left-most position. If the __SelectionStart__ property is set to a value equal to or greater than the number of characters in the text box, the insertion point is placed after the last character.
        

Setting the __SelectionLength__ to a number greater than 0 causes that number of characters to be selected, starting from the current insertion point. 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\editors\AutoCompleteBox.cs region=SetSelection}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\editors\AutoCompleteBox.vb region=SetSelection}} 

````C#
private void SetSelection()
{
    this.radAutoCompleteBox1.Text = "Pepsi; Sprite; Coca-Cola;";
    this.radAutoCompleteBox1.SelectionStart = 6;
    this.radAutoCompleteBox1.SelectionLength = 7;
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub SetSelection()
    Me.RadAutoCompleteBox1.Text = "Pepsi; Sprite; Coca-Cola;"
    Me.RadAutoCompleteBox1.SelectionStart = 6
    Me.RadAutoCompleteBox1.SelectionLength = 7
End Sub

````

{{endregion}}  

Alternatively, you can use the __Select__ method to select the same part of the text: 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\editors\AutoCompleteBox.cs region=SetSelectionRange}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\editors\AutoCompleteBox.vb region=SetSelectionRange}} 

````C#
private void SetSelectionRange()
{
    this.radAutoCompleteBox1.Text = "Pepsi;Sprite;Coca-Cola";
    this.radAutoCompleteBox1.Select(6, 7);
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub SetSelectionRange()
    Me.RadAutoCompleteBox1.Text = "Pepsi;Sprite;Coca-Cola"
    Me.RadAutoCompleteBox1.[Select](6, 7)
End Sub

````

{{endregion}}  

The both approaches produce same result:
