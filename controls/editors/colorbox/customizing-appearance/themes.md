This help article will demonstrate a step by step tutorial how to customize the `ControlDefault` theme for __RadColorBox__

1. Open [Visual Style Builder] ({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder/starting-vsb%})
2. Export the built-in themes in a specific folder by selecting `File` >> `Export Built-in Themes`.
3. Load a desired theme from the just exported files by selecting `File` >> `Open Package`.
4. Expand __RadColorBox__ and select the `ColorEditorColorBox`.

5. Open the `Edit Repository Item` dialog and change the `Margin`:
