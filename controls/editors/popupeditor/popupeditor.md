# WinForms PopupEditor Overview

__RadPopupEditor__ allows you to show any predefined or custom controls in its popup. By default the control should be associated with a __RadPopupContainer__. __RadPopupContainer__ on the other hand allows you to build your layout at design time. The controls added to the container will be shown in the popup window when the popup is opened.
