# Getting Started with WinForms Barcode

1. To start using **RadBarcode** just drag it from the toolbox and drop it at the form.

	The default **Symbology** is *QRCode* and the initial value is *12345*.

1. The value which is encoded is set through the **Value** property.

1. The width (size) of the bar-code elements is auto calculated from the size of the control.
