# Area

As a derivative of __Categorical__ series, __AreaSeries__ plot their data points using category-value couples. Once positioned on a plane the points are connected to form a line. Further, the area enclosed by this line and the categorical axis is filled. Below is a sample snippet that demonstrates how to set up two __AreaSeries__:

AreaSeries areaSeries = new AreaSeries();
areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(13, "Jan"));
areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(20, "Apr"));
areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(15, "Jul"));
areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(16, "Oct"));
this.radChartView1.Series.Add(areaSeries);
AreaSeries areaSeries2 = new AreaSeries(); 
areaSeries2.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(15, "Jan"));
areaSeries2.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(25, "Apr"));
areaSeries2.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(27, "Jul"));
areaSeries2.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalDataPoint(18, "Oct"));
this.radChartView1.Series.Add(areaSeries2);

The essential properties of AreaSeries coincide with these of LineSeries:

* __BorderWidth__: The property determines the thickness of the lines;

* __PointSize__: The property denotes the size of the points;

* __Spline__: Boolean property, which indicates whether the series will draw straight lines or smooth curves;

* __SplineTension__: The property sets the tension of the spline. The property will have effect only if the __Spline__ is set to *true*;

* __CombineMode__: A common property for all categorical series, which introduces a mechanism for combining data points that reside in different series, but have the same category. The combine mode can be *None*, *Cluster*,  *Stack* and *Stack100*. In the case of *AreaSeries*, *None* and *Cluster* mean that the series will be plotted independently of each other, so that they are overlapping. *Stack* plots the points on top of each other and *Stack100* presents the values of one series as a percentage of the other series. The combine mode is best described by a picture:
