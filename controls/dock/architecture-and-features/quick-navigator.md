# Quick Navigator

Use the __RadDock__ built-in pop-up __QuickNavigator__ to set the focus to any __DockWindow__ or __ToolWindow__. Press __Ctrl-Tab__ to open the navigation selector. Leave the __Ctrl__ button depressed and press the __Tab__ button to scroll through the names of the open __DockWindows__. If your current active __DockWindow__ is __DocumentWindow__, pressing the __Tab__ will scroll only through __DocumentWindows__; if the current active __DockWindow__ is __ToolWindow__, pressing the __Tab__ will scroll only through **ToolWindows**. You can jump from __DocumentWindows__ to __ToolWindows__ and vise versa by using the mouse or by using the arrow keys.
