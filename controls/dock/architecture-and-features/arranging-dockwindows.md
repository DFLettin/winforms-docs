# Arranging DockWindows

A **ToolTabStrip** container can include one or more __ToolWindows__. You can drag __ToolWindows__ in the following ways:

* Within a **ToolTabStrip**.

* From one **ToolTabStrip** to another existing **ToolTabStrip**. 

* From one **ToolTabStrip** to a new **ToolTabStrip**. 

* From a **ToolTabStrip** on a form to a floating **ToolTabStrip**. 

* From a floating **ToolTabStrip** to a docked **ToolTabStrip**. 

To move a __ToolWindow__, drag its title bar from the source location to the new target (or host) container. The [Docking Assistant]({%slug winforms/dock/architecture-and-features/docking-assistant%}) allows you to place the __ToolWindow__ in a specific relationship to the other panels.

In addition to moving __ToolWindows__ in different **ToolTabStrip** containers, you can use the context menu or **Pin** icon in the **DockPanel** title bar to make window auto-hidden. This mode collapses the window against an edge of __RadDock__. Another option is to move a **ToolWindow** to a container with tabbed documents. Both of these options:

* Save critical space on the end user screen.

* Allow more information to be presented at run time. 

* Allow the end user to customize their work space.

## Resizing Panels

To resize a **ToolTabStrip**/**DocumentTabStrip** container, click the splitter bar between two adjacent docking containers and drag the splitter to the desired location. The __ToolWindows__ and docking containers will automatically resize themselves to fit the space available to them, subject to any minimum or maximum size limits set at design time. You can find the splitter bar between docking containers as shown in the below image.
