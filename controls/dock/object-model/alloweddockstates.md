# AllowedDockStates
 
__AllowedDockState__ property gives you the ability to determine the available dock states per **ToolWindow**. There are several options for this properties which can be combined byÂ bitwise operations. For example:

#### Allow two states only.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\CreatingRadDock.cs region=allowedDockState}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\CreatingRadDock.vb region=allowedDockState}} 

````C#
toolWindow1.AllowedDockState = AllowedDockState.Docked | AllowedDockState.Floating;

````
````VB.NET
toolWindow1.AllowedDockState = AllowedDockState.Docked Or AllowedDockState.Floating

````

{{endregion}} 
 
This automatically will remove the caption buttons that may be responsible for an unwanted state, for example *Closed*. In addition, the unwanted menu items from the context menu will be disabled:

The following setting will disable the __Floating__ option:

#### Disable the floating dock state

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\CreatingRadDock.cs region=notFloating}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\CreatingRadDock.vb region=notFloating}} 

````C#
toolWindow1.AllowedDockState = ~AllowedDockState.Floating;

````
````VB.NET
toolWindow1.AllowedDockState = Not AllowedDockState.Floating

````

{{endregion}}
