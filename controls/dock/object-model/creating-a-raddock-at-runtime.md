# Creating a RadDock at Runtime
 
To create a __RadDock__ in code, construct a __RadDock__, set properties and add to the controls collection of the form. The example below creates a __RadDock__, adds it to the form and docks a single __ToolWindow__ to it. See [DockWindows]({%slug winforms/dock/object-model/toolwindow-and-documentwindow-properties-and-methods%}) for more information on instantiatingÂ __DockWindow__ at runtime.

#### Creating a simple RadDock instance

````C#
RadDock radDock1 = new RadDock();
radDock1.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
this.Controls.Add(radDock1);
ToolWindow toolWindow1 = new ToolWindow();
toolWindow1.Text = "A ToolWindow";
radDock1.DockWindow(toolWindow1, DockPosition.Left);

````
````VB.NET
Dim radDock1 As RadDock = New RadDock()
radDock1.Dock = DockStyle.Fill
Me.Controls.Add(radDock1)
Dim toolWindow1 As ToolWindow = New ToolWindow()
toolWindow1.Text = "A ToolWindow"
radDock1.DockWindow(toolWindow1, DockPosition.Left)

>caution You cannot set the DockPosition of the ToolWindow to Fill, unless you specify a target ToolWindow. If you try to set the DockPosition of a ToolWindow to Fill when there is no target ToolWindow, we throw an exception since a ToolWindow cannot fill RadDock entirely. This behavior is by design and it is the same as it is in Visual Studio. If you want to have a ToolWindow occupying RadDock entirely, you should dock it to a side (left/right/top/bottom) and set MainDocumentContainerVisible to false.
