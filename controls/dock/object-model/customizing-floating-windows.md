# Customizing Floating Windows
 
__FloatingWindows__ provide a useful way of reordering pieces of content on your screen. By default, **FloatingWindows** only appear with their close button enabled, and on top of the __RadDock__ that manages them. The following paragraphs demonstrate how this behavior can be changed. In all cases you need to handle the __FloatingWindowCreated__ event which is fired after the end-user starts dragging a **ToolWindow** to float it. At this point the **FloatingWindow** is created and it is just about to be shown. This is the moment when you can plug in and modify the window your way.

## Enabling Minimize and Maximize buttons  

In order to enable the `Maximize` and `Minimize` buttons for a **FloatingWindow**, you have to handle the `FloatingWindowCreated` event and set the **MinimizeBox**, **MaximizeBox** and **FormBorderStyle** properties of the **FloatingWindow** the following way: 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\CustomizingFloatingWindows.cs region=buttons}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\CustomizingFloatingWindows.vb region=buttons}} 

````C#
void radDock1_FloatingWindowCreated1(object sender, Telerik.WinControls.UI.Docking.FloatingWindowEventArgs e)
{
    e.Window.MaximizeBox = true;
    e.Window.MinimizeBox = true;
    e.Window.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.Sizable;
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub radDock1_FloatingWindowCreated1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Telerik.WinControls.UI.Docking.FloatingWindowEventArgs)
    e.Window.MaximizeBox = True
    e.Window.MinimizeBox = True
    e.Window.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.Sizable
End Sub

````

{{endregion}} 
 
The result is:

## Allowing the FloatingWindow to be under the main form

Sometimes, you may want to prevent the **FloatingWindow** from being always on top of the form that contains the **RadDock** manager. In order to do that, you need to extend the **FloatingWindow** class and use an instance of the extended type. 
In the extended **FloatingWindow** type, we need to override the **OnActivated** method, and after the base implementation takes place, we should remove the window from the collection of owned forms that the main form has: 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\CustomFloatingWindow.cs region=customFloatingWindow}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\CustomFloatingWindow.vb region=customFloatingWindow}} 

````C#
public class CustomFloatingWindow : FloatingWindow
{
    public CustomFloatingWindow(RadDock dockManager)
        : base(dockManager)
    {
    }
    protected override void OnActivated(EventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnActivated(e);
        Form dockForm = this.DockManager.FindForm();
        if (dockForm != null)
        {
            dockForm.RemoveOwnedForm(this);
        }
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
Public Class CustomFloatingWindow
    Inherits FloatingWindow
    Public Sub New(ByVal dockManager As RadDock)
        MyBase.New(dockManager)
    End Sub
    Protected Overrides Sub OnActivated(ByVal e As EventArgs)
        MyBase.OnActivated(e)
        Dim dockForm As Form = Me.DockManager.FindForm()
        If dockForm IsNot Nothing Then
            dockForm.RemoveOwnedForm(Me)
        End If
    End Sub
End Class

````

{{endregion}} 
 
Finally, we have to pass an instance of the custom **FloatingWindow** to the event arguments of the **FloatingWindowCreated** event: 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\CustomizingFloatingWindows.cs region=showBehind}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\CustomizingFloatingWindows.vb region=showBehind}} 

````C#
void radDock1_FloatingWindowCreated2(object sender, Telerik.WinControls.UI.Docking.FloatingWindowEventArgs e)
{
    CustomFloatingWindow customWindow = new CustomFloatingWindow(this.radDock1);
    e.Window = customWindow;
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub radDock1_FloatingWindowCreated2(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Telerik.WinControls.UI.Docking.FloatingWindowEventArgs)
    Dim customWindow As New CustomFloatingWindow(Me.RadDock1)
    e.Window = customWindow
End Sub

````

{{endregion}} 
 

Here is the result. As you can see, the form that contains the **RadDock** manager can cover the **FloatingWindow**:

## Setting the theme of a FloatingWindow

**FloatingWindow** is a descendant class of **RadForm**. As such, **FloatingWindow** has the __ThemeName__ property that you can set in the **FloatingWindowCreated** event in order to change its theme: 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\CustomizingFloatingWindows.cs region=themeName}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\CustomizingFloatingWindows.vb region=themeName}} 

````C#
void radDock1_FloatingWindowCreated3(object sender, Telerik.WinControls.UI.Docking.FloatingWindowEventArgs e)
{
    e.Window.ThemeName = "TelerikMetroBlue";
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub radDock1_FloatingWindowCreated3(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Telerik.WinControls.UI.Docking.FloatingWindowEventArgs)
    e.Window.ThemeName = "TelerikMetroBlue"
End Sub

````

{{endregion}}
