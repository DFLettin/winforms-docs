# Docking Singleton Forms
 
A typical scenario for an application showing many forms is to allow the end-users to get each type of form displayed only once. In addition, if the end-user tries to close a form it should become hidden instead of really closed and disposed, because this allows the developer to easily save the state (entered data) of the 'closed' forms. In this article we are going to demonstrate how you can implement that type of behavior with forms and __RadDock__.
        

>note The forms used in this article are standard forms that do not follow the real singleton pattern. The word 'singleton' in the approach is used only to describe the behavior of the form from the end-user's point of view.

## Docking 'Singleton' forms in RadDock

Let's assume that we have a __RadRibbonForm__ with two buttons each of which opens a specific type of form that lies in RadDock. Let's call these forms `YellowForm` and `GreenForm`. If a form of particular type is already opened, clicking the button that has opened it will not open any new forms of the same type. If the end-user closes the form after filling-in some data, clicking the 'show' button for this form will open the form with the data filled-in.

Here is how to do that:

1\. For each of the types of forms that we create, we should create a corresponding **DocumentWindow**/**ToolWindow** that serves as a container. Initially, global variables for the **DocumentWindows**/**ToolWindows** should be defined without creating new objects. 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\SingletonForms.cs region=fields}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\SingletonForms.vb region=fields}} 

````C#
DocumentWindow greenDockWindow;
DocumentWindow yellowDockWindow;

````
````VB.NET
Private greenDockWindow As DocumentWindow
Private yellowDockWindow As DocumentWindow

````

{{endregion}} 
 
2\. Upon clicking a button for opening a specific type of form, we should check if an object of the appropriate **DocumentWindow** exists. If it does not exist, this means that a form of the type that matches the **DocumentWindow** has never been created, so we need to create such a form together with the **DocumentWindow**. Note that we set the __CloseAction__ of the **DocumentWindow** to  *Hide*. When the end-user closes the **DocumentWindow**, it actually becomes hidden rather than closed and disposed. This allows us to use the same instance later. After creating the form and the window, we should dock the form in the window - this will allow us to control the form together with the **DocumentWindow** that hosts it using the globally defined **DocumentWindow** variables. Finally, we should just show the **DocumentWindow**. If the **DocumentWindow** has already been created the previous time we pressed the 'show' button, we should just show it:
