# Getting Started
 
In order toÂ dock your **UserControls** and **Forms** in __RadDock__, you just need to use the **DockControl** method. This method will dock a Form, a **UserControl**, or simply any **Control**. A **HostWindow** with **DockType** *ToolWindow* will be created to host the **Control**.

For example, the following code snippet will result in the screenshot shown below:

#### Docking a Form 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Dock\DockingForms.cs region=dockingForm}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Dock\DockingForms.vb region=dockingForm}} 

````C#
Form form = new Form();
form.BackColor = Color.Pink;
form.Text = "My Form";
this.radDock1.DockControl(form, DockPosition.Left);
form.Show();

````
````VB.NET
Dim form As Form = New Form()
form.BackColor = Color.Pink
form.Text = "My Form"
Me.RadDock1.DockControl(form, DockPosition.Left)
form.Show()

````
