The above examples demonstrates how to add the different card types in a simple **ChatCardMessage**. **RadChat** offers **ChatCarouselMessage** which allows adding and visualizing multiple card elements. Additional information is available in the [Messages]({%slug winforms/chat/chat-items/messages%}) help article.

## Card Actions

Each card allows you to add a certain action that can be handled:

The RadChat.**CardActionClicked** event is fired once a user clicks on the action's text. The **CardActionEventArgs** gives you access to the **ChatCardAction** and user's data.
