# Adding items

The __GanttViewDataItem__ Collection Editor allows you to add tasks to the gantt view in design time.

The more important properties of the item you need to set up are:

* __Title:__ This is the text that will be displayed over the item if it is a Task item. No text is displayed for summary and milestone items.
            

* __Start:__ The start date and time for the task.
            

* __End:__ The end date and time for the task.
            

* __ReadOnly:__ Determines whether this item is editable.
            

* __Visible:__ Determines whether this item will be visible in RadGanttView.
            

* __ContextMenu:__ Allows you to assign a particular context menu to each individual item. Individual context menus are shown with higher priority than the default of the controlâ€™s context menu.
            

* __Progress:__ Allows you to set the completion of the task.
