# Getting Started

The __RadSchedulerNavigator__ control is used with a __RadScheduler__ control and represents a navigation tool that makes using the __RadScheduler__ easier.

To use the __RadSchedulerNavigator__ control you should add it to your form and also add a __RadScheduler__ control. After that, either by using the *Associate Scheduler* action in the Smart Tag of the  Scheduler Navigator or by using the __AssociatedScheduler__ property in the Property Grid of the Visual Studio Designer, you can bind the __RadSchedulerNavigator__ to a __RadScheduler__ control:
