# Binding to Custom Fields

__RadScheduler__ has full support for binding to custom fields i.e. __RadScheduler__ can be bound to an email field in your data source. The process consists of five steps:      

1. Add your custom field to your data source.

1. Add a custom appointment class that stores this additional data. Note: *The easiest way to do that is to inherit from the Appointment class that RadScheduler uses by default*.

3\. Implement a simple appointment factory and inherit from the default appointment dialog and add some input controls and logic for your custom field. The easiest way to do the latter is to create a form in Visual Studio that inherits from the standard *Edit Appointment *dialog, then open it in the designer, and add your custom UI. The extended form from the example is shown on the screenshot below (notice the Email field on it):

4\. You should assign the custom AppointmentFactory to RadScheduler:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToCustomFields.cs region=customFactory}}                 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToCustomFields.vb region=customFactory}}
````C#
this.radScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = new CustomAppointmentFactory();

````
````VB.NET
Me.RadScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = New CustomAppointmentFactory()

```` 



{{endregion}} 

5\. You need to handle the AppointmentEditDialogShowing event of RadScheduler in order to replace the default appointment dialog with a custom one. You will also have to give an instance of your appointment factory to the RadScheduler so it can create instances of your custom appointment class:            

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToCustomFields.cs region=loadAndShowing}}
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToCustomFields.vb region=loadAndShowing}}
````C#
private IEditAppointmentDialog appointmentDialog = null;  
protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnLoad(e);
    this.radScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = new CustomAppointmentFactory();
    this.radScheduler1.AppointmentEditDialogShowing += new EventHandler<AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs>(radSchedulerDemo_AppointmentEditDialogShowing);
}
void radSchedulerDemo_AppointmentEditDialogShowing(object sender, AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs e)
{
    if (this.appointmentDialog == null)
    {
        this.appointmentDialog = new CustomAppointmentEditForm();
    }
    e.AppointmentEditDialog = this.appointmentDialog;
}

````
````VB.NET
Private appointmentDialog As IEditAppointmentDialog = Nothing
Protected Overrides Sub OnLoad(ByVal e As EventArgs)
    MyBase.OnLoad(e)
    Me.RadScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = New CustomAppointmentFactory()
    AddHandler RadScheduler1.AppointmentEditDialogShowing, AddressOf radSchedulerDemo_AppointmentEditDialogShowing
End Sub
Private Sub radSchedulerDemo_AppointmentEditDialogShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs)
    If Me.appointmentDialog Is Nothing Then
        Me.appointmentDialog = New CustomAppointmentEditForm()
    End If
    e.AppointmentEditDialog = Me.appointmentDialog
End Sub

6\. Finally, you have to add a mapping for your custom field to the appointment mapping info. Note that the same appointment factory instance is assigned to the event provider.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToCustomFields.cs region=mappings}}             
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToCustomFields.vb region=mappings}}
````C#
SchedulerBindingDataSource dataSource = new SchedulerBindingDataSource(); 
dataSource.EventProvider.AppointmentFactory = this.radScheduler1.AppointmentFactory;
AppointmentMappingInfo appointmentMappingInfo = (AppointmentMappingInfo)dataSource.EventProvider.Mapping;
appointmentMappingInfo.Mappings.Add(new SchedulerMapping("Email", "Email"));

````
````VB.NET
Dim dataSource As New SchedulerBindingDataSource()
dataSource.EventProvider.AppointmentFactory = Me.RadScheduler1.AppointmentFactory
Dim appointmentMappingInfo As AppointmentMappingInfo = DirectCast(dataSource.EventProvider.Mapping, AppointmentMappingInfo)
appointmentMappingInfo.Mappings.Add(New SchedulerMapping("Email", "Email"))
