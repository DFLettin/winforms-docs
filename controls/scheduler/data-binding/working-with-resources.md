# Working with Resources

## Overview

For the end-user, __RadScheduler__ resources can be company resources, such as conference rooms, vehicles, laptops, or AV equipment, which can be booked and assigned to a particular event.

## Binding the Resources Collection

See the [Using DataSource property]({%slug winforms/scheduler/data-binding/using-datasource-property%}) and [Binding to Business Objects]({%slug winforms/scheduler/data-binding/binding-to-business-objects%}) topics on how to bind the Resources Collection.

>note If the data bound object is a list of appointments,Â set the __Resources__ property of the AppointmentMappingInfo object to "Resources".
>Do not set the __Resources__ property of the AppointmentMappingInfo object to "Resources" if the data bound object has a property that has no Resources collection, but has only a __ResourceId__ property.
>

## Adding Resources Manually

To add resources to RadScheduler's Resource drop down (visible in the appointment dialog by default), you need to use the __Resources__ collection's __Add__ method and to pass a new __Resource__ instance. Pass a unique ID and a description in the constructor:

>note A Resource object also has an __Image__ property that is not displayed as of this writing. In the near future, resource images will be displayed by the scheduler in the resource selection control.

>important As of **R1 2021** the EditAppointmentDialog provides UI for selecting multiple resources per appointment. In certain cases (e.g. unbound mode), the *Resource* **RadDropDownList** is replaced with a **RadCheckedDropDownList**. Otherwise, the default drop down with single selection for resources is shown. To enable the multiple resources selection in bound mode, it is necessary to specify the AppointmentMappingInfo. **Resources** property. The **Resources** property should be set to the name of the relation that connects the **Appointments** and the **AppointmentsResources** tables.
