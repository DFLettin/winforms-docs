This tutorial will show you how to bind __RadScheduler__ from the Visual Studio design time surface, by only using the __RadScheduler__ design-time support, and without writing any code. The tutorial uses the data base which comes with the installation of Telerik UI for WinForms.

1\. Open Visual Studio and start a new Windows Forms project. Open the form, created by the project.

2\. Drag a __RadScheduler__ from the toolbox to your form.

3\. Drag a __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ from the toolbox to your form.

4\. Select __RadScheduler__ and open its action list (smart tag). In it, there is a __DataSource__ property, which is used to specify the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ component which will be used as a data source in __RadScheduler__. Select the instance of the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ that we just added and close the smart tag:

![WinForms RadScheduler Smart Tag](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding003.png) 

5\. Open the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ smart tag. It shows two types of provider properties, which can be used for setting the data sources for the __Appointments__ (EventProvider) and the __Resources__ (ResourceProvider):

![WinForms RadScheduler Smart Tag Data Source](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding004.png)

6\. Set the __Appointments__ and the __Resources__ data sources. To do that, in the *Properties* window, open the __EventProvider__ property. Drop down the __DataSource__ sub-property list and select __Add Project DataSource...__ This step will display the Data Source Configuration Wizard dialog.

7\. In the "Choose a Data Source Type" page of the wizard, select the __Database__ type and click the __Next__ button to continue.

8\. In the "Choose a Data Connection" page of the wizard, add a connection to the SchedulerData.mdf file supplied with Telerik UI for WinForms distribution.

  - Click the __New Connection...__ button to display the Add Connection dialog.

  - Click the __Change__ button and select the Access Database File option.

  - Set the Database File Name to the Schedulerdata.mdb file located in the Telerik UI for WinForms installation directory under \Examples\DataSources.

  - Click __OK__ to close the Add Connection dialog.

9\. Back in the "Choose a Data Connection" page of the wizard, click the __Next__ button to continue.

10\. A dialog will pop-up to ask where the file should be located. Choose __No__ to leave the file located in the \Examples\DataSources directory.

11\. In the "Save the Connection String in the Application Configuration File" click the __Next__ button to continue.

12\. In the "Choose Your Database Objects" page of the wizard, select the "Tables" checkbox to automatically select the *Appointments*, *Resources* and *AppointmentsResources* tables.

13\. Click __Finish__ to complete the wizard and close the dialog. This step will create a DataSet component and add it to the component tray below the form designer.

14\. Then you need to edit the mappings between the objects used in __RadScheduler__ and your data source objects. Open the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ ActionList and specify the __DataSource__ for both the *EventProvider* and *ResourceProvider* to the binding source.
            
15\. While still in the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ ActionList, set the __DataMember__ properties for both the *EventProvider* and *ResourceProvider* to the respective tables.            

1. The *EventProvider* takes care of the data, related to the Appointments (Events) and has the following properties:                

	1. Data Source, which should be a DataSet object;                    

	1. Data Member, which usually is bound to Appointments (Appointments is the name of the data table in the Data set)                    

	1. Edit Appointment Mapping (see #16 below) 

1. The *ResourceProvider* takes care of the data, related to Resources and has the following properties:                

	1. Data Source, which should be a DataSet object;                    

	1. Data Member which usually is bound to Resources (Resources is the name of the data table in the Data set)                    

	1. Edit Resource Mapping (see #17 below)

In our case we should set the __DataMember__ properties for both the *EventProvider* and *ResourceProvider* to __Appointments__ and __Resources__ respectively: 

![WinForms RadScheduler SchedulerBindingDataSource](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding006.png) 

16\. While still in the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ ActionList, click on the *Edit Appointment Mapping* link.

![WinForms RadScheduler Mapping](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding007.png) 

This will invoke the *Appointment Mapping Dialog* which provides you with an easy and intuitive UI for mapping __Appointment__ properties with __DataSource__ properties. Map all of the properties with their respective counterpart, whereas:

  1. __UniqueID__ is the ID of your appointments

  1. __[Resources]({%slug winforms/scheduler/data-binding/working-with-resources%})__ is a relation in the dataset, in this case __AppointmentsAppointmentsResources__

  1. __[Exceptions]({%slug winforms/scheduler/data-binding/working-with-exceptions%})__ is a self-relation in the dataset, in this case __AppointmentsAppointments__. 

At the end the *Appointment Mapping Dialog* should look like the following screen shot. Save and Close the dialog when done:

![WinForms RadScheduler Appointment Mapping Dialog](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding008.png)  

17\. By using the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ ActionList, click on the *Edit Resource Mapping* link to edit the ResourceMappingInfo:

![WinForms RadScheduler Edit Resource Mapping](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding009.png)

18\. Select the ID and ResourceName for the respective properties and close the dialog:

![WinForms RadScheduler Resource Mapping Dialog](images/scheduler-data-binding-codeless-data-binding010.png)

19\. Fill the data tables in the data set:

#### Fill Data

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\DataBindingWalkthrough.cs region=codelessDatabinding}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\DataBindingWalkthrough.vb region=codelessDatabinding}} 

````C#
AppointmentsTableAdapter appointmentsAdapter = new AppointmentsTableAdapter();
appointmentsAdapter.Fill(this.schedulerDataDataSet.Appointments);
ResourcesTableAdapter resourcesAdapter = new ResourcesTableAdapter();
resourcesAdapter.Fill(this.schedulerDataDataSet.Resources);
AppointmentsResourcesTableAdapter appointmentsResourcesAdapter = new AppointmentsResourcesTableAdapter();
appointmentsResourcesAdapter.Fill(this.schedulerDataDataSet.AppointmentsResources);

````
````VB.NET
Dim appointmentsAdapter As New AppointmentsTableAdapter()
appointmentsAdapter.Fill(Me.SchedulerDataDataSet.Appointments)
Dim resourcesAdapter As New ResourcesTableAdapter()
resourcesAdapter.Fill(Me.SchedulerDataDataSet.Resources)
Dim appointmentsResourcesAdapter As New AppointmentsResourcesTableAdapter()
appointmentsResourcesAdapter.Fill(Me.SchedulerDataDataSet.AppointmentsResources)

````

{{endregion}} 

20\. Use the __Rebind__ method of the __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ object if the dataset is filled after applying the event provider data source:

#### Rebind the Binding Source

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\DataBindingWalkthrough.cs region=Rebind}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\DataBindingWalkthrough.vb region=Rebind}} 

````C#
schedulerBindingDataSource1.Rebind();

````
````VB.NET
SchedulerBindingDataSource1.Rebind()

````

{{endregion}} 

21\. Run the project.
