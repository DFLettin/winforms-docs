# Binding to Business Objects

What if your scheduling data originates from somewhere other than an easily accessible database? An API that accesses a legacy system or an email based system are two examples that might fit this description. __RadScheduler__ allows binding to objects of any arbitrary structure.

Binding to objects follows the same basic pattern as binding to database tables. You must assign a collection of objects to an instance of __SchedulerBindingDataSource__. You also need to define mappings so that the appointment data expected in the scheduler (Start, End, Subject, etc.) is satisfied by specific properties in the bound objects.

The code below is an example appointment. Keep in mind that the particular construction of the *CustomAppointment* class and the names of its properties are arbitrary. The mappings will decide where properties are used. Notice that the object implements the __INotifyPropertyChanged__ interface. Without this interface implementation the populated appointment object data will not show up in the scheduler.

## Grouping by Resources

To use grouping by resource in this scenario, first you will need to create the business object that represents the resources:

            if (this.id != value)
            {
                this.id = value;
                this.OnPropertyChanged("Id");

    }

Now we need to bind the __ResourceProvider__ of __SchedulerBindingDataSource__ to a collection of __CustomResource__ objects:

    resources.Add(resource);
}
ResourceMappingInfo resourceMappingInfo = new ResourceMappingInfo();
resourceMappingInfo.Name = "Name";

Next we need to create the relation between appointments and resources. We can create either one-to-many relation or many-to-many relation. The following two sections cover each of these scenarios.

## One-to-many Relation

To create a one-to-many relation between appointments and resources we need to add a property of type __EventId__ to the business object that represents an appointment:

#### Define One-to-many Relation

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\CustomAppointment.cs region=CustomAppointmentWithOneToManyRelation}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\CustomAppointment.vb region=CustomAppointmentWithOneToManyRelation}}

    get
    {
        return this.resourceId;
    }
    set
    {
        if (this.resourceId != value)
        {
            this.resourceId = value;
            this.OnPropertyChanged("ResourceId");
        }
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
'other fields…
Private _resourceId As EventId
'other properties…
Public Property ResourceId() As EventId
    Get
        Return Me._resourceId
    End Get
    Set(value As EventId)
        If Not Object.Equals(Me._resourceId, value) Then
            Me._resourceId = value
            Me.OnPropertyChanged("ResourceId")
        End If
    End Set
End Property

````

{{endregion}} 

To map the new property, add the following setting to your __AppointmentMappingInfo__ instance:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.cs region=OneToMany1}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.vb region=OneToMany1}} 

````C#
appointmentMappingInfo.ResourceId = "ResourceId";

````
````VB.NET
appointmentMappingInfo.ResourceId = "ResourceId"

````

{{endregion}} 


>note In this scenario you should __not__ set the __Resources__ property of the __AppointmentMappingInfo__ 
>

#### Set Resource

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.cs region=OneToMany2}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.vb region=OneToMany2}} 

````C#
CustomAppointment myAppointment =
new CustomAppointment(
DateTime.Now.AddHours(appointmentNumber),
DateTime.Now.AddHours(appointmentNumber + 2),
"Appointment " + appointmentNumber.ToString(),
"Description for Appointment " + appointmentNumber.ToString(),
"Conference room " + appointmentNumber.ToString());
appointments.Add(myAppointment);
//set the resource id
myAppointment.ResourceId = new EventId(i % 2);

````
````VB.NET
Dim myAppointment As New CustomAppointment(DateTime.Now.AddHours(appointmentNumber), DateTime.Now.AddHours(appointmentNumber + 2), "Appointment " + appointmentNumber.ToString(), "Description for Appointment " + appointmentNumber.ToString(), "Conference room " + appointmentNumber.ToString())
appointments.Add(myAppointment)
'set the resource id

````

{{endregion}} 

To test this scenario, assign each appointment with a __ResourceId__ and enable grouping by setting RadScheduler’s __GroupType__ property:

#### Group By Resource

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.cs region=OneToMany3}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.vb region=OneToMany3}} 

````C#

````VB.NET

````

{{endregion}} 

>caption Figure 2: One-to-Many Relation
![WinForms RadScheduler One-to-Many Relation](images/scheduler-data-binding-binding-to-business-objects002.png)

## Many-to-many Relation

This scenario can be implemented similarly to the previous one. Instead of the __ResourceId__ property, we should add a __Resources__ property which represents a collection of __EventId__ objects:

#### Define Many-to-many Relation

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\CustomAppointment.cs region=CustomAppointmentWithManyToManyRelation}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\CustomAppointment.vb region=CustomAppointmentWithManyToManyRelation}}

public List<EventId> Resources
{
    get
    {
        return this.resources;
    }
    set
    {
        if (this.resources != value)
        {
            this.resources = value;
            this.OnPropertyChanged("Resources");
        }
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
'other fields…
Private _resources As New List(Of EventId)
'other properties…

    End Get
    Set(value As List(Of EventId))
        If Not Me._resources.Equals(value) Then
            Me._resources = value
            Me.OnPropertyChanged("Resources")
        End If
    End Set
End Property

````
````VB.NET
appointmentMappingInfo.Resources = "Resources"

Now we can add a resource to an appointment by adding its id in the __Resources__ collection of our business objects:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.cs region=ManyToMany2}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\DataBinding\BindingToBusinessObjects.vb region=ManyToMany2}} 

````C#
myAppointment.Resources.Add(new EventId(resources[i%3].Id));

````
````VB.NET
myAppointment.Resources.Add(New EventId(resources(i Mod 3).Id))

````

{{endregion}}
