|Adding Custom Fields to RadScheduler AppointmentsWhen using RadScheduler for WinForms, it will almost always need to be customized in some way. This could come in the form of custom dialogs, context menus, or even custom appointments.In this blog entry, I am going to explain the steps required to add a custom field to RadScheduler [Read full post ...](  http://blogs.telerik.com/winformsteam/posts/10-04-02/adding_custom_fields_to_radscheduler_for_winforms_appointments.aspx )||

The following tutorial will demonstrate how you can customize the default __EditAppointmentDialog__ (shown above) by adding a custom field to it. In our case, we are going to add an E-mail field. This field will not only exist in the dialog as a control, but will also be stored as a value in the custom appointment provided below.
        
Here is a step by step guide how to achieve that:

1\. First we have to create a new form (let's call it CustomAppointmentEditForm) which derives from __EditAppointmentDialog__ in order to extend the default schedulerâ€™s dialog.

2\. Open the dialog in Design Time and add a label and a text box to under the Resource label and text box. Name the text box __txtEmail__

3\. Here is the form's implementation:
 
{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\CustomAppointmentEditForm.cs region=customAppEditForm}}
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\CustomAppointmentEditForm.vb region=customAppEditForm}}           
````C#
public partial class CustomAppointmentEditForm : EditAppointmentDialog
{
    public CustomAppointmentEditForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }
    protected override void LoadSettingsFromEvent(IEvent ev)
    {
        base.LoadSettingsFromEvent(ev);
        AppointmentWithEmail appointmentWithEmail = ev as AppointmentWithEmail;
        if (appointmentWithEmail != null)
        {
            this.txtEmail.Text = appointmentWithEmail.Email;
        }
    }
    protected override void ApplySettingsToEvent(IEvent ev)
    {
        AppointmentWithEmail appointmentWithEmail = ev as AppointmentWithEmail;
        if (appointmentWithEmail != null)
        {
            appointmentWithEmail.Email = this.txtEmail.Text;
        }
        base.ApplySettingsToEvent(ev);
    }
    protected override IEvent CreateNewEvent()
    {
        return new AppointmentWithEmail();
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
Public Class CustomAppointmentEditForm
    Public Sub New()
        InitializeComponent()
    End Sub
    Protected Overrides Sub LoadSettingsFromEvent(ByVal ev As IEvent)
        MyBase.LoadSettingsFromEvent(ev)
        Dim appointmentWithEmail As AppointmentWithEmail = TryCast(ev, AppointmentWithEmail)
        If appointmentWithEmail IsNot Nothing Then
            Me.txtEmail.Text = appointmentWithEmail.Email
        End If
    End Sub
    Protected Overrides Sub ApplySettingsToEvent(ByVal ev As IEvent)
        Dim appointmentWithEmail As AppointmentWithEmail = TryCast(ev, AppointmentWithEmail)
        If appointmentWithEmail IsNot Nothing Then
            appointmentWithEmail.Email = Me.txtEmail.Text
        End If
        MyBase.ApplySettingsToEvent(ev)
    End Sub
    Protected Overrides Function CreateNewEvent() As IEvent
        Return New AppointmentWithEmail()
    End Function
End Class

4\. Create a new appointment class (let's call it AppointmentWithEmail) which derives from the __Appointment__ class and add an Email property as shown:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.cs region=appWithMail}}
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.vb region=appWithMail}} 
````C#
    
public class AppointmentWithEmail : Appointment
{
    public AppointmentWithEmail() : base()
    {
    }
    
    protected override Event CreateOccurrenceInstance()
    {
        return new AppointmentWithEmail();
    }
    
    private string email = string.Empty;
    
    public string Email
    {
        get
        {
            return this.email;
        }
        set
        {
            if (this.email != value)
            {
                this.email = value;
                this.OnPropertyChanged("Email");
            }
        }
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
Public Class AppointmentWithEmail
Inherits Appointment
    Public Sub New()
        MyBase.New()
    End Sub
    Protected Overrides Function CreateOccurrenceInstance() As [Event]
        Return New AppointmentWithEmail()
    End Function
    Private _email As String = String.Empty
    Public Property Email() As String
        Get
            Return Me._email
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As String)
            If Me._email <> value Then
                Me._email = value
                Me.OnPropertyChanged("Email")
            End If
        End Set
    End Property
End Class

````

{{endregion}} 

5\. Create an appointment factory which returns our AppointmentWithEmail when creating appointments:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.cs region=customAppFactory}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.vb region=customAppFactory}} 

````C#
    
public class CustomAppointmentFactory : IAppointmentFactory
{
    public IEvent CreateNewAppointment()
    {
        return new AppointmentWithEmail();
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
Public Class CustomAppointmentFactory
Implements IAppointmentFactory
    Public Function CreateNewAppointment() As IEvent Implements IAppointmentFactory.CreateNewAppointment
        Return New AppointmentWithEmail()
    End Function
End Class

````

{{endregion}} 

6\. Subscribe to the AppointmentEditDialogShowing event and in the event handler use the AppointmentEditDialog property of the event arguments to change the default dialog with the custom one you just created. For optimization, you can create a global variable, which can be reused, instead of creating a new instance of the form every time.
     
{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.cs region=showing}}        
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.vb region=showing}} 

````C#
CustomAppointmentEditForm appointmentDialog = null;
void radScheduler1_AppointmentEditDialogShowing(object sender, AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs e)
{
    if (this.appointmentDialog == null)
    {
        this.appointmentDialog = new CustomAppointmentEditForm();
    }
   e.AppointmentEditDialog = this.appointmentDialog;
}

````
````VB.NET
Private appointmentDialog As CustomAppointmentEditForm = Nothing
Private Sub radScheduler1_AppointmentEditDialogShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs)
    If Me.appointmentDialog Is Nothing Then
        Me.appointmentDialog = New CustomAppointmentEditForm()
    End If
    e.AppointmentEditDialog = Me.appointmentDialog
End Sub

````

{{endregion}} 

7\. Last, but not least we should assign the custom AppointmentFactory to our RadScheduler. This will come in handy when you create your appointments in-line:
            

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.cs region=settingFactory}}
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.vb region=settingFactory}} 
````C#
this.radScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = new CustomAppointmentFactory();

````
````VB.NET
Me.RadScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = New CustomAppointmentFactory()

````

>important As of **R1 2021** the EditAppointmentDialog provides UI for selecting multiple resources per appointment. In certain cases (e.g. unbound mode), the *Resource* **RadDropDownList** is replaced with a **RadCheckedDropDownList**. Otherwise, the default drop down with single selection for resources is shown. To enable the multiple resources selection in bound mode, it is necessary to specify the AppointmentMappingInfo. **Resources** property. The **Resources** property should be set to the name of the relation that connects the **Appointments** and the **AppointmentsResources** tables.
