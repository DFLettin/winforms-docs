# Working with Views

The scheduler displays dates and times using a "view" that can be [Day]({%slug winforms/scheduler/views/day-view%}), [MultiDay]({%slug winforms/scheduler/views/multiday-view%}), [Week]({%slug winforms/scheduler/views/week-view%}),  [Work Week]({%slug winforms/scheduler/views/work-week-view%}), [Month]({%slug winforms/scheduler/views/month-view%}) and [Timeline]({%slug winforms/scheduler/views/timeline-view%}).
        

>note The difference between a day view and a multi-day view is that while the day view is constrained to showing a single sequence of consecutive days (for example 7th through 10th, or 10th through 12th, or just the 15th), the multi-day view can display all of the above sequences at once.
>

At any one time the scheduler displays a view using a descendant of the __SchedulerView__ class: __SchedulerDayView, SchedulerWeekView, SchedulerMonthView__ and __SchedulerTimelineView__. Each view has special properties particular to the view. Use the RadScheduler __GetDayView()__, __GetWeekView(),__  __GetMonthView()__ and __GetTimelineView()__ methods to get the respective views. Here's an example that retrieves the day view and sets the ruler to start at the second hour and stop at the fifth hour:

#### Get Day View

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.cs region=getDayView}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.vb region=getDayView}} 

````C#
SchedulerDayView dayView = radScheduler1.GetDayView();
dayView.RulerStartScale = 2;
dayView.RulerEndScale = 5;

````
````VB.NET
Dim dayView As SchedulerDayView = RadScheduler1.GetDayView()
dayView.RulerStartScale = 2
dayView.RulerEndScale = 5

````

{{endregion}} 

After running the code, the day view for the scheduler looks like this screenshot:

Change between views by changing the __ActiveViewType__ property to one of the __SchedulerViewType__ enumeration members.

#### ActiveViewType Property

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.cs region=activeViewType}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.vb region=activeViewType}} 

````C#
radScheduler1.ActiveViewType = SchedulerViewType.Day;

````
````VB.NET
RadScheduler1.ActiveViewType = SchedulerViewType.Day

````

{{endregion}} 

Retrieve the view that is currently being displayed by using the ActiveView property, cast it to be the ActiveViewType.

#### ActiveView Property

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.cs region=weekCount}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.vb region=weekCount}} 

````C#
radScheduler1.ActiveViewType = SchedulerViewType.Month;
(radScheduler1.ActiveView as SchedulerMonthView).WeekCount = 2;

````
````VB.NET
RadScheduler1.ActiveViewType = SchedulerViewType.Month
TryCast(RadScheduler1.ActiveView, SchedulerMonthView).WeekCount = 2

````

{{endregion}}

Detect changes to the view by handling the __ActiveViewChanging__ and __ActiveViewChanged__ events. As always, the "Changing" event arguments provide the ability to cancel the view change, but also the "old" and "new" views before and after the view changes transpires:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.cs region=activeViewChanging}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\Views\WorkingWithViews.vb region=activeViewChanging}} 

````C#
void radScheduler1_ActiveViewChanging(object sender, SchedulerViewChangingEventArgs e)
{
    this.Text = String.Format("Old: {0} New: {1}",
    e.OldView.ViewType.ToString(), e.NewView.ViewType.ToString());
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub radScheduler1_ActiveViewChanging(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SchedulerViewChangingEventArgs)
    Me.Text = String.Format("Old: {0} New: {1}", e.OldView.ViewType.ToString(), e.NewView.ViewType.ToString())
End Sub

````
