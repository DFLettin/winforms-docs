# Improve Load Performance

In order to achieve optimal load performance with **RadFileDialogs** controls, you should be familiar with the following performance tips:

* Whenever possible, you should use a single instance of a dialog for multiple openings. This will reduce the opening time for every open after the initial one.

* Setting the **ExpandToCurrentDirectory** to *False* will improve the loading time.

* Setting an **InitialDirectory** that has fewer directories and files will reduce the loading time.

* When developing an application that contains **RadFileDialogs**, run it in Release mode, instead of in Debug mode. This way you will avoid the caught exceptions while traversing the file system, which will improve performance.
