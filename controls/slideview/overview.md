# WinForms SlideView Overview

__RadSlideView__ is a flexible navigation control that allows you to slide between different views, thus providing an interactive navigation. With it, you can build a gallery display to show your images and content efficiently. It is suitable for browsing images or other items in a collection, such as photos in an album or items in a product details page, one item at a time.
