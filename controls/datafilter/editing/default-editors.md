# Default Editors

After you populate **RadDataFilter** with descriptor items, you are ready to build a filter expression. For each filter condition, a filter node is added. Each filter node is composed of a field name, a filter operator and a value. As soon as you click one of the filter node's elements, the editor for this element is activated.

The default editor for the field name element and for the operator element is **TreeViewDropDownListEditor** offering you to select an option from a predefined list of available items. When you try to add a new filter node or modify an existing one, the appropriate editor is activated for the value element considering the DataFilterDescriptorItem.**DescriptorType**. You can find the default editor types listed below:

|Editor|Description|
|----|----|
|**TreeViewDropDownListEditor**|Relevant for the field name element and for the operator element.|
|**TreeViewDateTimeEditor**|Relevant for *DateTime* values.|
|**TreeViewSpinEditor**|Relevant for numeric values.|
|**DataFilterColorPickerEditor**|Relevant for Color values.|
|**TreeViewTextBoxEditor**|Default editor for the rest of the value types.|

>note In *R1 2017* **DataFilterCheckboxEditor** was used for Boolean properties. Now, a permanent check box is displayed and the value filter node element doesn't enter in edit mode.
