# WinForms Cardview Overview

With __RadCardView__, users can display and edit text data organized in a card layout. This powerful control incorporates a __RadLayoutControl__ that allows you to modify the layout both in the Visual Studio designer and during run-time.

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}

The below list shows the main features of the control:

* Create complex layouts where the controls are automatically resized according to the current available size.
* Arrange the controls in the form at runtime - your users will be able to rearrange the controls according to their needs.
* Save and load the layout.
* Group the underlying controls in tabs.
* Expand/Collapse groups.

To help you get up to speed with __RadCardView__, we prepared a short [Getting Started]({%slug winforms/cardview/getting-started%}) guide.
