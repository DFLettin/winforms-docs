# Text Tool

The __TextTool__ allows you to enter the edit mode of a __RadDiagramItem__ as soon as you click on it. Furthermore, you can use this tool to draw text shapes. As it isn't active by default, you can use the RadDiagram.__ActiveTool__ property to activate it:

#### Active Tool

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Diagram\DiagramPopulatingWithData.cs region=ActiveTool}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Diagram\DiagramPopulatingWithData.vb region=ActiveTool}} 

````C#
            
this.radDiagram1.ActiveTool = Telerik.Windows.Diagrams.Core.MouseTool.TextTool;

````
````VB.NET
Me.RadDiagram1.ActiveTool = Telerik.Windows.Diagrams.Core.MouseTool.TextTool

````

{{endregion}} 


Let's consider we already have a shape in __RadDiagram__. As soon as you click on the shape, you will enter its edit mode. This way you can easily modify its content.

And what is more, as soon as you activate the __TextTool__, you can dynamically create a text shape by dragging a rectangle on the diagramming surface:
