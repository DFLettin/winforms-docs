# Creating and Using Contextual Tab Groups

The __Contextual Tab Groups__ can be used to group tabs in a context and thus improve the usability of your UI. __Contextual Tab Groups__ can be easily added to the __RadRibbonBar__ either programmatically or in the Visual Studio designer. Tabs can be quickly associated with a __Contextual Tab Group__ with drag-and-drop in the Visual Studio designer.

This topic demonstrates how __Contextual Tab Groups__ are created and how tabs are associated with them.

## Creating a Contextual Tab Group and Associating Tabs

1. Add a __RadRibbonForm__ to your project by either changing the base class of an existing form to __RadRibbonForm__, or using the 'Add New Item...' dialog for your project.

2. Open the __RadRibbonForm__ designer and select the __RadRibbonBar__ control.

3. Create 4 tabs in the __RadRibbonBar__ with the following names: Write, Insert, Layout, Formatting

4. Create 2 __Contextual Tab Groups__ by clicking on 'Add Context...'. Call the __Contextual Tab Group__ 'Appearance' and press enter:

![WinForms RadRibbonBar Add Contextual Tab](images/ribbonbar-creating-and-using-contextual-tab-groups001.png)

5. Drag and drop the __Formatting__Â  tab onto the __Appearance__ group and do the same with the __Layout__ tab:

![WinForms RadRibbonBar Formatting Contextual Tab](images/ribbonbar-creating-and-using-contextual-tab-groups002.png)

The __Contextual Tab Group__ is positioned over both the __Formatting__ and __Layout__ tabs and sizes to fit the sum of the lengths of both tabs.

>note Tabs that are associated with a Contextual Tab Group are always positioned at the end of the TabStrip.
>

>note Contextual Tab Groups always extend to the sum of the lengths of the tabs associated with them.
