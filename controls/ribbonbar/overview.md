* The entire application functionality is accessible from a single place.

* __RadRibbonBar__ is divided into tabs such as *Write*, *Insert*, and *Page Layout*. Tabs can be permanently visible or shown contextually.

* When the users clicks on a tab, they are presented with the ribbon groups such as *Clipboard*, *Font*, and *Paragraph*.

* Each group can hold an unlimited number of controls including toolbars, combo boxes, galleries, and other Telerik controls.

* The Application Menu Button in the upper left of the ribbon provides quick access to the most important commands listed in the Application Menu.

* An optional *Quick Access Toolbar* above or below the ribbon tabs an be used for customization or frequently-used commands.

* Key tips can be used to help users learn the shortcut keys to activate individual controls.
