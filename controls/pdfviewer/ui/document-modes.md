# Document Modes 

The document presenter is responsible for displaying the pages of the document, navigating in it, managing the selection markers, conversion between view coordinates and document location coordinates, plus proper response to mouse and touch events.

## Pages Mode

This document presenter displays the pages in a vertical order and is used by default by __RadPdfViewer__. There is a fixed margin between the pages, and each page is centered horizontally inside the __RadPdfViewer__.
