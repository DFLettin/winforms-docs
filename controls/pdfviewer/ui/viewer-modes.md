# Viewer Modes

There are three __FixedDocumentViewerModes__ which specify the behavior of __RadPdfViewer__ when you left-click in the document and move the mouse around (without releasing the left button of the mouse):

* *None*: The control does nothing;

* *Pan*: The document is scrolled in the respective direction;

* *TextSelection* â€“ selection is initiated, which stops when you release the button of the mouse;

The viewer mode can be changed using the __RadPdfViewerNavigator__ (as shown in the picture).
