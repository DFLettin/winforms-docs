# Printing Support

RadPdfViewer can be used with [RadPrintDocument]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/radprintdocument%}) just as any other control that supports printing â€“ drag a __RadPrintDocument__ to the form and set the __Printed Object__ to the desired viewer.

As such, __RadPdfViewer__ allows you to benefit from the features that __RadPrintDocument__ provides: header, footer, watermark, preview and settings dialogs.

## Using UI

__RadPdfViewerNavigator__ allows you to print the currently shown PDF document with a simple button click which opens the *Print Preview* dialog.

>note As of R2 2021 RadPdfViewer offers the **UseBufferedPrinting** property. If it is set to **true**, the page will be printed in an image that will be send to the printer at once. Loss of quality is possible.

## Printing With Code

__RadPdfViewer__ also exposes the two known methods which allow you to easily print the document without involving any complicated settings:

#### Printing
