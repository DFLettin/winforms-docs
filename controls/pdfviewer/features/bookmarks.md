# Bookmarks (Outlines)

**RadPdfViewer** enables you to open documents and show the bookmarks they contain in a bookmarks panel. Bookmarks or Outlines are a tree-structured hierarchy that the reader presents as a visual table of contents separated from the actual content as a side panel. The Bookmark items allow users, by interacting with them, to navigate through parts of the document and/or invoke different actions.  

>note The Bookmarks (Outlines) functionality is available as of **R3 2018 SP1**.

## Visualizing Bookmarks

In **RadPdfViewer**, the bookmarks are shown via using a **RadTreeView** simulating a navigation pane. This is a control representing an area that can display different navigation panels, including the Bookmarks of the PDF document which serve as a table of contents. The bookmarks are displayed in the same container in which you can find the [thumbnails]({%slug winforms/pdfviewer/thumbnails%}). The **ThumbnailListWidth** property controls the width of the panel that hosts the thumbnails and the bookmarks.

You can access the tree-view that visualizes the bookmarks by the ContainerElement.**BookmarksTree** property. Each **RadTreeNode** stores in its **Tag** property the associated **Telerik.Windows.Documents.Fixed.Model.Navigation.BookmarkItem**. Each **BookmarkItem** offers the following properties:
* **Title** - gets or set the title of the bookmark item.
* **Destination** - gets or sets the Telerik.Windows.Documents.Fixed.Model.Navigation.Destination associated with the bookmark.
* **IsExpanded** - gets or sets a value indicating whether the bookmark is expanded. 

## Methods

The following public methods are exposed to **RadPdfViewer**:

* **ShowBookmarks** - shows the Pdf document's bookmarks.
* **HideBookmarks** - hides the Pdf document's Bookmarks
* **GetCurrentBookmark** - gets the nearest bookmark from the Pdf document's.
