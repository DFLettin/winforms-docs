# Applying Styles 

The topic explains how to apply, add, modify and delete styles using the predefined UI of RadRichTextEditor.

* [Apply Style](#apply-style)

* [Add Style](#add-style)

* [Modify Style](#modify-style)

* [Delete Style](#delete-style)

## Apply Style

![WinForms RadRichTextEditor richtexteditor-ui-for-applying-rich-text-formatting-ribbon-ui-applying-styles 001](images/richtexteditor-ui-for-applying-rich-text-formatting-ribbon-ui-applying-styles001.png)

Applying a Style from the Quick Styles gallery is easy and intuitive. The only thing you should consider is where the caret is located.
   
In the image above the first paragraph has style applied only to part of the text - the selection. The rest of the text has the default *Normal* style.
   
As opposed to that, positioning the caret somewhere in the paragraph will style it. 
  
It is also possible to apply a style using the Styles dialog as shown in the picture below.

## Add Style

Other than using the API to declare a style, you can also use the UI.

>tip More info on how to create a style from code can be found in the [Styles article]({%slug winforms/richtexteditor/features/styles%})

Clicking the *New* button on the Styles dialog invokes the __Create new style from formatting__ dialog where you can specify the properties of the new style:
        
* __Name__ - corresponding to the Name property of the **StyleDefinition**;
            
* __Style type__ - the Type of the style;
            
* __Style based on__ - specifies that the current style inherits the **StyleDefinition** set to this property. Corresponds to the **BasedOn** property;
            
* __Style for following paragraph__ - specifies the style that will be applied to a newly created paragraph following a paragraph with this style. The respective property is **NextStyleName**;

You can also specify the wanted formatting as the dialog slightly changes depending on the type of style you are defining.

The check box on the bottom - *Add to Quick Style list*, allows you to add custom styles to the Quick Styles for easier access.

## Modify Style

All styles can be modified using the **Modify** option in the **Styles** dialog.

This will change the formatting of the style as well as the formatting of document elements that already have this style applied.

As all pictures in the Styles dialog and in Quick Styles are dynamically populated, a snapshot of the new look will be included immediately.
        
## Delete Style

The predefined set of Styles in **RadDocument** cannot be deleted using the UI. Only the custom styles you've created can be removed using the __Delete__ option in the styles dialog.
