# Table Styles Gallery

**RadRichTextEditor**'s concept of styles allows you to use a predefined set of formatting options for different document elements.  More about this you can learn in the **Styles** article [here]({%slug winforms/richtexteditor/features/styles%}).
      
One of the supported type of styles is Table styles. The __TableStylesGallery__ was introduced as a way to easily create, delete, modify and apply table styles in a document. The gallery initially loads all the table styles which are present in the document and a set of built-in styles. Currently, built-in styles for *Office2010* and *Office2013* are supported and you can easily configure which version to be used.
      
## Apply Table Style

Applying a Table Style from the **TableStylesGallery** is easy and intuitive. You can apply a style from the preview or open the gallery and chose  one of the styles using the pop up.
