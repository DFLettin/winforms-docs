# RadDocumentMerger Overview

**RadDocumentMerger** introduces an API that enables users to merge two __RadDocument__ instances or append them to each other. When performing merging operations, you may encounter conflicts between the different settings of two documents. Such conflicts can be resolved/avoided by changing the settings of **RadDocumentMerger**.

## Create a RadDocumentMerger

When instantiating the **RadDocumentMerger** class, you should pass to its constructor a [RadDocument]({%slug winforms/richtexteditor-/document-elements/raddocument%}) instance. This parameter represents the document that is used as a target when performing the merging operations.

#### Example 1: Create a RadDocumentMerger

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\GettingStarted\Main.cs region=DocumentMerger}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\GettingStarted\Main.vb region=DocumentMerger}} 

````C#
Telerik.WinForms.Documents.Model.Merging.RadDocumentMerger merger = new RadDocumentMerger(targetDocument);

````
````VB.NET
Dim merger As Telerik.WinForms.Documents.Model.Merging.RadDocumentMerger = New RadDocumentMerger(targetDocument)

````

{{endregion}} 

The document passed to the constructor can be obtained through the **Document** property of the __RadDocumentMerger__ instance.

You can use the methods of the __RadDocumentMerger__ class to [insert the content of the desired documents at the caret position]({%slug winforms/richtexteditor/features/merge-documents/merge%}) or just [append]({%slug winforms/richtexteditor/features/merge-documents/append%}) it to the target document.
