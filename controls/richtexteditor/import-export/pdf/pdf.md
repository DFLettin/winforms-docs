# Pdf

[Portable Document Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) (PDF) is a file format used to present documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware and operating system. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it.
