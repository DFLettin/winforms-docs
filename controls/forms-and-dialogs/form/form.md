# WinForms Form Overview

The __RadForm__ control is an extended standard Windows Form that fully supports the [Telerik Presentation Framework (TPF)]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/overview%}) and the Telerik's theming mechanism. The control is built of a [RadTitleBar]({%slug winforms/forms-and-dialogs/radtitlebar%}) component and a border that can be easily designed in the Visual Style Builder. __RadForm__ also supports MDI (Multiple Document Interface) and Right-to-Left languages. Other features of __RadForm__ are the active/inactive visual states support, runtime switching between customized or plain Windows Form and also the possibility for adding __RadElement__ instances in the Title Bar Element.

>note RadForm supports just one shape. If you need more advance shapes please refer to [ShapedForm]({%slug winforms/forms-and-dialogs/shapedform%}).
