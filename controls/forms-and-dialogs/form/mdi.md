# MDI
 
__RadForm__ can be used in Multiple Document Interface (MDI) scenarios. With MDI, a single menu bar is shared between all child windows, reducing clutter and increasing the efficient use of screen space. __RadForm__ fits well in MDI cases by automatically providing minimize, restore, maximize, and inactive states.

## Adding MDI Child Forms to RadForm

The following code snippet adds three __RadForm__ instances to a MDI container and applies different theme to each child:

## Default MDI Menu Strip

When a MDI child Form is maximized, it automatically hides its title bar and the parent form displays a default MDI menu. This menu contains controls can execute the basic window commands on the currently maximized MDI child:

The appearance of the default MDI menu can be designed in the Visual Style Builder.

## Menu Merging

Each MDI child that contains __RadMenu__ can have its menu merged with the __RadMenu__ control of the MDI parent form, if any. You can read more on this topic in the [Menu Merge section]({%slug winforms/menus/menu/menu-merge/menu-merge-in-mdi-applications%}).
