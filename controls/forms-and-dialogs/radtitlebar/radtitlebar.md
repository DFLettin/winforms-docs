# RadTitleBar
  
__RadTitleBar__ control is used in forms and provides functionality for dragging, minimizing, maximizing and closing the form. This control is internally used by  __RadForm__.

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}    

To include a title bar with help, maximize, minimize and close button functionality simply drag it from the toolbox on the desired form. This control is great addition to the [ShapedForm]({%slug winforms/forms-and-dialogs/shapedform%}).      	

To customize the help, minimize, maximize and close buttons, use the __RadTitleBar.TitleBarElement's HelpButton, MinimizeButton, MaximizeButton__ and __CloseButton__ objects. Each button isÂ a __RadButtonElement__ type that include properties to control text, image, and layout.
