# BarcodeView

**RadBarcodeView** can be used to create and show barcodes. You can generate and visualize barcodes in a machine-readable format via the **RadBarcodeView** control by providing numeric or character data. 

>note As of R2 2022 Telerik UI for WinForms suite offers a new improved RadBarcodeView control. You can check out the old documentation for the [RadBarcode]({%slug winforms/barcode/overview%}) control which is now obsolete.
