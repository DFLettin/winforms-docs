# SparkLineSeries

__SparkLineSeries__ plot their CategoricalSparkDataPoint on Cartesian Area. The following example shows how you can create the line series.

#### Create SparkLineSeries

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Sparkline\SparklineCode.cs region=LineSeries}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Sparkline\SparklineCode.vb region=LineSeries}}
````C#
public void CreateLineSeries()
{
    var lineSeries = new SparkLineSeries();
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(13));
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(20));
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(15));
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(5));
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(29));
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(8));
    lineSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(22));
    lineSeries.ShowHighPointIndicator = true;
    lineSeries.ShowLowPointIndicator = true;
    lineSeries.HighPointShape = new StarShape(5, 3);
    this.radSparkline1.Series = lineSeries;
}
