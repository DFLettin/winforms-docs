# SparkAreaSeries

As a derivative of Categorical series, SparkAreaSeries plot their data points using __CategoricalSparkDataPoints__. Once positioned on a plane the points are connected to form a line. Further, the area enclosed by this line and the categorical axis is filled. Below is a sample snippet that demonstrates how to set up __SparkAreaSeries__:

#### Create SparkAreaSeries

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Sparkline\SparklineCode.cs region=AreaSeries}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Sparkline\SparklineCode.vb region=AreaSeries}}
````C#
public void CreateAreaSeries()
{
    var areaSeries = new SparkAreaSeries();
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(13));
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(20));
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(15));
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(5));
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(29));
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(8));
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(new CategoricalSparkDataPoint(22));
    areaSeries.ShowHighPointIndicator = true;
    areaSeries.ShowLowPointIndicator = true;
    areaSeries.HighPointShape = new StarShape(5, 3);
    this.radSparkline1.Series = areaSeries;
}

````
````VB.NET
Public Sub CreateAreaSeries()
    Dim areaSeries = New SparkAreaSeries()
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(New CategoricalSparkDataPoint(13))
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(New CategoricalSparkDataPoint(20))
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(New CategoricalSparkDataPoint(15))
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(New CategoricalSparkDataPoint(5))
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(New CategoricalSparkDataPoint(29))
    areaSeries.DataPoints.Add(New CategoricalSparkDataPoint(8))

    areaSeries.ShowHighPointIndicator = True
    areaSeries.ShowLowPointIndicator = True
    areaSeries.HighPointShape = New StarShape(5, 3)
    Me.radSparkline1.Series = areaSeries
End Sub
