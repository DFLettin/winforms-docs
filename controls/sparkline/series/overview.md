# Series Overview

>caption Figure 1: Supported Series

![WinForms RadSparkline Supported Series](images/series-overview001.png)

The currently supported series are:
* [SparkAreaSeries]({%slug radsparkline-sparkareaseries%})
* [SparkBarSeries]({%slug radsparkline-sparkbarseries%})
* [SparkLineSeries]({%slug radsparkline-sparklineseries%})
* [SparkScatterSeries]({%slug radsparkline-sparkscatterseries%})
* [SparkWinLossSeries]({%slug radsparkline-sparkwinlossseries%})

>note The **SparkAreaSeries**, **SparkBarSeries**, and **SparkWinLossSeries** expose the **BaselineValue** property defining a value on the vertical axis determining how the view will be divided into top and bottom halves. By default *0* is considered as the base line. The property is extremely useful in the **SparkWinLoss** series where one can define a threshold different than *0* to indicate wins and losses.
