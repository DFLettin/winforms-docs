# WinForms Wizard Overview

__RadWizard__ will help you differentiate a complex process into separate steps and provide your users with the ability to govern the process upon their decisions. It is useful for creating  installation, registration and other types of wizards.    

**RadWizard** supports both *Wizard 97* and *Wizard Aero* specifications. The control provides the developers with predesigned *Welcome*, *Completion* and *Internal* pages. Follows an example of a **RadWizard** Welcome page:
 
{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}

The [design time]({%slug winforms/wizard/design-time%}) capabilities of the **RadWizard** control are rich and intuitive to use. They allow the developers to create and manage the control and its pages. Handful [events]({%slug winforms/wizard/events%}) help you to follow the state of the control at run time, implement custom pages sequence and page processing validation.
