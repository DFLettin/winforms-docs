# Item Text Formatting

The text of each item can be formatted by using the __FormatInfo__, __FormatString__ and __FormattingEnabled__ properties. The __FormattingEnabled__ property decides whether the __FormatInfo__ and __FormatString__ will be used to format each itemâ€™s text. When the __FormattingEnabled__ property is set to *false*, setting the __FormatInfo__ and __FormatString__ properties will have no effect until the __FormattingEnabled__ is set to *true*. __FormatInfo__ is a class that implements the __IFormatProvider__ interface. If __FormatInfo__ is *null* the current culture of the executing thread is used as the __IFormatProvider__. The formatting functionality will work similarly to the standard Microsoft ListBox formatting.
