# DropDownList

__RadDropDownList__ is an enhanced alternative to the standard Windows Forms combo box control. __RadDropDownList__ can be [bound to data]({%slug winforms/dropdown-listcontrol-and-checkeddropdownlist/dropdownlist/populating-with-data/data-binding%}) sources. It allows you to [replace] ({%slug winforms/dropdown-listcontrol-and-checkeddropdownlist/dropdownlist/custom-items%}) its major components giving you control over its visual and data behavior. You can exercise control over the [scrolling logic]({%slug winforms/dropdown-listcontrol-and-checkeddropdownlist/dropdownlist/scrolling%}), the items layout and even the low level data binding logic by providing their own data layer.

You can review below the [Key Features]({%slug winforms/dropdown-listcontrol-and-checkeddropdownlist/dropdownlist%}#key-features) that __RadDropDownList__ supports.

## Key Features

* __Filtering__: RadDropDownList supports [filtering]({%slug winforms/dropdown-listcontrol-and-checkeddropdownlist/dropdownlist/filtering%}) of its items.

* __Scrolling__: In the scenatio where you cannot fit the __RadListDataItems__ in the popup, a vertical scroll bar will appear so that you can scroll down and select the desire item.

* __Selection__: RadDropDownList supports three types of selection modes which you can wxplore in this [article.]({%slug winforms/dropdown-listcontrol-and-checkeddropdownlist/dropdownlist/selection%})
