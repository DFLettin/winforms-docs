# Design Time

To start using __RadDropDownList__ just drag it from the toolbox and drop it at the form.
 
## Smart Tag

Select __RadDropDownList__ and click the small arrow on the top right position in order to open the __Smart Tag__. The __Smart Tag__ for __RadDropDownList__ lets you quickly access common tasks involved with building __RadDropDownList__ elements and customizing appearance through themes.
