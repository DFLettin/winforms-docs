# Data binding
 
Data binding is a mechanism for automatic population of the __RadDropDownList__ with items, based on the provided data structure. Three properties control the data binding:

* __DataSource__ - specifies the data structure to be bound.
          

* __DisplayMember__ - specifies the particular field in the data source which will be used from the items in __RadDropDownList__ for their Text.
          

* __ValueMember__ - specifies the particular field in the data source which will be stored in the items Value property.
          
__RadDropDownList__ supports data binding either at design time or at run time:

## Data binding at design time

You can set the __DataSource__ property at design time in the *Properties* window of Visual Studio.

1. Select the __DataSource__ property and click the drop-down arrow to display all existing data sources on the form. 

1. Click the *Add Project Data Sourceâ€¦* link and follow the instructions in the *Data Source Configuration Wizard*  to add a data source to your project. You can use a single database table.

1. Afterwards, you need to specify the __DisplayMember__ and __ValueMember__ properties.

## Data binding at run time

You can bind __RadDropDownList__ programmatically as well. The following code snippet demonstrates how to bind it to a collection of custom objects:
