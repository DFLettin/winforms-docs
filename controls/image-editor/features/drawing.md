The following snippet shows how you can add text using the RadImageEditor API.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\ImageEditor\ImageEditorFeatures.cs region=DrawText}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\ImageEditor\ImageEditorFeatures.vb region=DrawText}}
````C#
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.DrawString("Test", 12, Color.Red, 200, 200, 120);
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.SaveState();

````
````VB.NET
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.DrawString("Test", 12, Color.Red, 200, 200, 120)

* Square
* Ellipse
* Circle
* Arrow 

### Draw Shape Programmatically

To draw a shape in the code behind you need to provide a path. The bellow code demonstrates how you ca create a RoundRectShape: 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\ImageEditor\ImageEditorFeatures.cs region=DrawShape}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\ImageEditor\ImageEditorFeatures.vb region=DrawShape}}
````C#
RoundRectShape shape = new RoundRectShape();
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);
var path = shape.CreatePath(rect);
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.DrawShape(path, Color.Red, Color.Green, 3);
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.SaveState();

````
````VB.NET
Dim shape As New RoundRectShape()
Dim rect As New Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100)
Dim path = shape.CreatePath(rect)
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.DrawShape(path, Color.Red, Color.Green, 3)
radImageEditor1.ImageEditorElement.SaveState()

````
