# Selection

The **RadSyntaxEditor** control supports not only selection via the UI but also exposes API to work with the selection programmatically. In addition, the selection can be controlled via the keyboard by a number of key combinations. You can also disable selection in the control if your business scenario demands it.

## UI Selection

The user is able to select the content inside **RadSyntaxEditor** in the same way as in Visual Studio. This is done by clicking on the desired position and dragging to the desired end of the selection.

The UI selection is enabled by default. To enable or disable it use the **IsSelectionEnabled** property

#### Enable/Disable selection
{{source=..\SamplesCS\SyntaxEditor\SyntaxEditorGettingStarted.cs region=EnableSelection}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\SyntaxEditor\SyntaxEditorGettingStarted.vb region=EnableSelection}}

````C#
this.radSyntaxEditor1.IsSelectionEnabled = true;

````
````VB.NET
Me.RadSyntaxEditor1.IsSelectionEnabled = True

````

## Programmatic Selection

Through the control's **Selection** property, you can programmatically manipulate the selection and get additional details for the selected span(s). The following example demonstrates how you can get the entire selection as a string through the **GetSelectedText** method.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\SyntaxEditor\SyntaxEditorGettingStarted.cs region=ProgrammaticSelection}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\SyntaxEditor\SyntaxEditorGettingStarted.vb region=ProgrammaticSelection}}

````C#
string selectedText = this.radSyntaxEditor1.SyntaxEditorElement.Selection.GetSelectedText();

````
````VB.NET
Dim selectedText As String = Me.RadSyntaxEditor1.SyntaxEditorElement.Selection.GetSelectedText()

````
