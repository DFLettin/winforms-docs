* __Common Tasks__

	* __New Theme Manager__: Adds a new __RadThemeManager__ component to the form.

	* __Edit UI elements__: Opens a dialog that displays the *Element Hierarchy Editor*. This editor lets you browse all the elements in the control.

	* __Open Gallary__: Opens the [gallery]({%slug winforms/gauges/radialgauge/getting-started%}) with available graph designs.
	
	* __Dock in Parent Container__: Docks the control to its parent.
	
	* __Save Gauge Layout to XML__: Saves the control`s layout to XML.

	* __Load Gauge Layout to XML__: Loads the control`s layout from XML.

The Smart tag of __RadRadialGauge__ lets you quickly access and modify the __Items__ collection via the Smart tag's option *Edit Gauge Items*. Thus, you can add new gauge elements, modify or remove the existing ones:

Additionally, you can perform some modifications to the gauge elements and save the constructed layout via the *Save Gauge Layout to XML* option. Afterwards, you can add an empty gauge and load the stored layout via the *Load Gauge Layout from XML*.
