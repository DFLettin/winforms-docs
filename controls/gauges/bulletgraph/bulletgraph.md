# WinForms BulletGraph Overview

The __RadBulletGraph__ control is a variation of linear gauge. It combines a number of indicators into one control making it light-weight, customizable, and straightforward to setup and use. The control is a great tool for dashboards as it is the optimal way to present a lot of information in relatively small size.
