# Sorting

RadPivotGrid provides various sorting options. 

## Understanding Sorting Mechanism

The **RowGroupDescriptions** and **ColumnGroupDescriptions** can be sorted ascending (from A to Z) and descending (from Z to A) based on the names of the properties they are showing or based on the aggregated description. We will explain this with a simple **RadPivotGrid**:

>caption Figure 1: Ascending Rows

![WinForms RadPivotGrid Ascending Rows](images/pivotgrid-sorting001.png)

The **RowGroupDescription** in this **RadPivotGrid** is the Product field. By default the sorting of the columns is ascending (from A to Z) based on the headers: Copy holder, Glare filter, Mouse pad, Printer stand. You can easily change the sorting of the Product description and set it to descending (from Z to A). One of the ways to achieve this is to simply click the “Product” element. This will lead to the result below. The row headers are reordered based on their names.

You can also apply sorting based on some of the **PropertyAggregateDescription** you are using. In the example above you can apply sorting of the Product names in ascending (from A to Z) or descending (from Z to A) format based on the Total Sum of Quantity (green rectangle). Here is the new view of **RadPivotGrid** when the Product **RowGroupDescription** is sorted in descending order based on the Total Sum of Quantity:

>note The sorting is set on the **ColumnGroupDescriptions** or **RowGroupDescriptions**. You cannot set sorting on the **AggregateDescriptions**, but you can sort the columns or rows based on the aggregated values.

## Applying Sort Rules

The sorting can be applied in the code behind or at run-time with the help of **RadPivotFieldList**.

* Sorting based on the **GroupName** (header) can be Ascending (from A to Z) or Descending (from Z to A). The default value is Ascending, but you can change it by using **SortOrder** property:

#### Using the SortOrder Property

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PivotGrid\PivotGridSorting.cs region=SortByGroupName}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PivotGrid\PivotGridSorting.vb region=SortByGroupName}} 

````C#
PropertyGroupDescription propGroupDescription = (PropertyGroupDescription)this.radPivotGrid1.RowGroupDescriptions[0];
propGroupDescription.SortOrder = Telerik.Pivot.Core.SortOrder.Descending;
this.radPivotGrid1.ReloadData();

````
````VB.NET
Dim propGroupDescription As PropertyGroupDescription = DirectCast(Me.radPivotGrid1.RowGroupDescriptions(0), PropertyGroupDescription)
propGroupDescription.SortOrder = Telerik.Pivot.Core.SortOrder.Descending
Me.radPivotGrid1.ReloadData()

````

{{endregion}}

* Sorting based on the **GrandTotals** can be *Ascending* or *Descending*. To set such sort mechanism you have to use the **SortOrder** and **GroupComparer** properties:

#### Using SortOrder and GroupComparer

{{source=..\SamplesCS\PivotGrid\PivotGridSorting.cs region=SortGrandTotals}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\PivotGrid\PivotGridSorting.vb region=SortGrandTotals}} 

````C#
PropertyGroupDescription propGroupDescription = (PropertyGroupDescription)this.radPivotGrid1.RowGroupDescriptions[0];
propGroupDescription.SortOrder = Telerik.Pivot.Core.SortOrder.Descending;
propGroupDescription.GroupComparer = new GrandTotalComparer() { AggregateIndex = 0 };
this.radPivotGrid1.ReloadData();

````
````VB.NET
Dim propGroupDescription As PropertyGroupDescription = DirectCast(Me.radPivotGrid1.RowGroupDescriptions(0), PropertyGroupDescription)
propGroupDescription.SortOrder = Telerik.Pivot.Core.SortOrder.Descending
propGroupDescription.GroupComparer = New GrandTotalComparer() With { _
 .AggregateIndex = 0 _
}
Me.radPivotGrid1.ReloadData()

````

{{endregion}}

>note The **AggregateIndex** property is set based on the count of your aggregate descriptions. If you have two aggregates the first one will have **AggregateIndex** = 0 and the second - **AggregateIndex** = 1.
>

## Changing the Sorting at runtime

**RadPivotFieldList** gives you the ability to change the sorting of a description at runtime. When you click on a Row Label or a Column Label field, a new popup opens with several sorting options. If you want to save the current sorting, but only change its order (for example the above **RadPivotGrid** is sorted based on the Total Sum of Quantity in Descending order, and you want to change it to Ascending) you can use the first two options which are doing exactly this - just changing the **SortOrder**:

If you want to change the property based on which the sort is applied, then you can use the third option - More Sorting Options. A new dialog will be opened in which you can choose Ascending or Descending order of the sort. When you click the dropdown button you'll see a full list of the possible sorting basis:
