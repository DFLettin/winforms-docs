**RadPivotGrid** for WinForms is a control which provides functionality similar to the functionality of PivotTables in MS Excel. It takes large chunks of data and summarizes it in a human readable way by the help of aggregates and field descriptors. The end-user can easily get an aggregated view of the data that would best suit their needs by dragging and dropping the items of the field descriptors and the aggregates. **RadPivotGrid** can also sort the data and show subtotals and grand totals at the end or at the beginning of the summarized data. It supports the UI virtualization available in **RadGridView**, so it can easily handle large data sets bringing to you top performance and low memory footprint even in such scenarios. As a control based on the Telerik Presentation Framework, **RadPivotGrid** also supports themes that you can quickly personalize with the help of Visual Style Builder.
