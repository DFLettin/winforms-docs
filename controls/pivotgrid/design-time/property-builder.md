The RadPivotGrid Property Builder is a design time wizard that consists of a preview pane on the right side and also three tabs on the left which contain different editors that allow you to modify the most commonly used properties:

* __General tab__: On this tab you can set the __DataSource__ and __DataMember__ properties, as well as the __ErrorString__ and __EmptyValueString__ properties. Additionally there are a bunch of boolean properties related to enabling or disabling the build-in features of RadPivotGrid: drag & drop, context menus, sorting, filtering, resizing, etc.

* __Layout tab__: On this tab you can edit the properties related to modifying the appearance of RadPivotGrid, like the layout type of the headers, the positions of the __SubTotals/GrandTotals__ and the width or height of the different areas.

* __Fields__: On this tab there is a RadPivotFieldList control which allows you to organize the fields from your data source in the desired descriptor collection.
