# WinForms PivotGrid Overview

**RadPivotGrid** provides printing support out of the box and this functionality can be customized through a style object, events or with inheritance. **RadPivotGrid** uses the same printing mechanism as RadGridView and RadScheduler and therefore shares the common features provided by [RadPrintDocument]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/radprintdocument%}). You can modify the appearance and the layout of the printed pages by using the variety of options provided by the __PivotGridPrintStyle__ class.

RadPivotGrid has two public methods available for printing â€“ __Print__ and __PrintPreview__ methods. The first method will directly send a print job to the default printer with the settings currently saved in the __PrintStyle__ property. This method has one overload available which can show a system __PrintDialog__ with the available printers and their options.

The other available method is __PrintPreview__. It opens a new **RadPrintPreviewDialog** which is discussed in details [here]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/end-user-functionality/print-preview-dialog%}).

#### Print Preview Dialog
