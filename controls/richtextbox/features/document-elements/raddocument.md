# RadDocument

__RadDocument__ is the root element for __RadRichTextBox's__ content. It holds the collection of __Sections__ defined for the __RadRichTextBox__ content. It also allows you to configure the appearance of its child elements. Currently only one section in the document is supported and all declared sections are merged into one when the document is measured.

This topic will explain how you can customize the contents of the RadDocument

## Customize the contents of the RadDocument

__RadDocument__ exposes several properties that allow you to customize the layout of the elements placed underneath it. Here is a list of them:

* __DefaultPageLayoutSettings__ - this property is of type __PageLayoutSettings__. The __PageLayoutSettings__ class exposes the following properties:

  * __Height__ - represents the height of the page.

  * __Width__ - represents the width of the page.

>note The __DefaultPageLayoutSettings__ get applied only when Paged layout mode is used.
