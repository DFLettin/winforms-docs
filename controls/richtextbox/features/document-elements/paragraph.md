# Paragraph

The paragraph class allows you to separate the content into paragraphs. It is responsible for displaying inline elements such as __Span__, __HyperlinkRangeStart__ and __End__, __InlineImage__ etc. You are also able to configure the appearance of the paragraph by modifying its parameters.

This topic will explain you how to:

* [Use Paragraphs](#use-paragraphs)

* [Add inline elements to a Paragraph](#add-inline-elements-to-a-paragraph)

* [Customize the Paragraph](#customize-the-paragraph)

## Use Paragraphs

The __Paragraph__ can be used only in the context of a [Section]({%slug winforms/richtextbox-(obsolete)/features/document-elements/section%}) or a TableCell element. The section exposes a collection of Blocks, to which the paragraphs can be added.

{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextBox\Features\Document Elements\RichTextBoxParagraph.vb region=UseParagraphs}} 

````C#
Section section = new Section();
Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph();
section.Blocks.Add(paragraph);
this.radRichTextBox1.Document.Sections.Add(section);

````
````VB.NET
  
Dim section As New Section()
Dim paragraph As New Paragraph()
section.Blocks.Add(paragraph)
Me.RadRichTextBox1.Document.Sections.Add(section)

````

{{endregion}}

## Add inline elements to a Paragraph

To add inline elements such as Span, HyperlinkRangeStart and End, or InlineImage you have to use the Inlines collection of the Paragraph. 

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextBox\Features\Document Elements\RichTextBoxParagraph.cs region=AddInlineElementsToParagraph}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextBox\Features\Document Elements\RichTextBoxParagraph.vb region=AddInlineElementsToParagraph}} 

````C#
Section sect = new Section();
Paragraph para = new Paragraph();
Span span = new Span("Span declared in code-behind");
para.Inlines.Add(span);
sect.Blocks.Add(para);
this.radRichTextBox1.Document.Sections.Add(sect);

````
````VB.NET
Dim sect As New Section()
Dim para As New Paragraph()
Dim span As New Span("Span declared in code-behind")
para.Inlines.Add(span)
sect.Blocks.Add(para)
Me.RadRichTextBox1.Document.Sections.Add(sect)

````

{{endregion}}

## Customize the Paragraph

The __Paragraph__ exposes several properties that allow you to customize the layout of the elements placed underneath it. Here is a list of them:

* __FontSize__ - represents the font size of the text inside the __Paragraph__. If not explicitly set to its child elements, they inherit its value.

* __LineSpacing__ - specifies the value for the space between the lines.

* __LineSpacingType__ - specifies the type of spacing:

* __AtLeast -__ the space between the lines should equal or greater than the value of the __LineSpacing__ property.

* __Auto -__ the space between the lines is determined automatically.

* __Exact -__ the space between the lines should equal to the value of the __LineSpacing__ property.

* __LeftIndent -__ represents the size of the indent to the left size of the __Paragraph__. The indent gets applied together with the respective margins to the layout.

* __RightIndent__ - represents the size of the indent to the right size of the __Paragraph__. The indent gets applied together with the respective margins to the layout.

* __SpacingAfter__ - represents the size of the empty space after the __Paragraph__.

* __SpacingBefore__ - represents the size of the empty space before the __Paragraph__.

* __TextAlignment__ - represents the alignment of the text inside the __Paragraph__.
