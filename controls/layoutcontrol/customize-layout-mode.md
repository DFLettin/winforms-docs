The customize dialog allows you to save/load the layout. This can be achieved by using the corresponding buttons.

## The DragOverlay

The __DragOverlay__ is a separate control which is shown when the customize dialog is opened. It contains snapshot of the formâ€™s layout and is used for items arranging. There is a __DragOvelay__ property which is allowing you to access this control. It allows you to access the drag and drop service as well.
