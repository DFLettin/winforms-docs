# Splash Screen

The WinForms SplashScreen allows you to display a Telerik themed control that notifies the user that the program is loading. You can customize the image of the splash screen, its animations and loading process visualization.

## Key Features:

* Customizable image content: The control allows you to easily set the splash screen image. 

* Built-in progress bar: By default, the control shows an indeterminate progress indicator. You can easily change this and indicate some loading progress.

* Customizable content/footer UI: You can customize the content/footer of the splash screen by only setting the Content/Footer properties.

* Animations: The control comes with show and hide animations that can be fine-tuned. 

* Rich set of themes: You can use the Telerik themes to modernize your UI or implement different designs that can be changed at runtime.
