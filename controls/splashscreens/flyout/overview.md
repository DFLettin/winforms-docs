# WinForms Flyout Screen Overview

Thank you for choosing __Flyout Screen__!

Flyout control is a powerful tool that combines the overlay form with any container control, which allows you to fit any design you like. It can be used as a notification to notify the user of a long-running background process with user control inside its content. Another use case is to fit in scenarios where a complex user control needs to be shown which requires user input.
