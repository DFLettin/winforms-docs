# Flyout

Thank you for choosing __Flyout Screen__!

Flyout control is a powerful tool that combines message box and pop-up control in one. It can be used either as a notification to notify the user of a long-running background process or as a message box with user control inside its content. The second use case will fit in scenarios where a complex user control needs to be shown which requires user input.
