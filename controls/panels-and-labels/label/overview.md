# WinForms Label Overview

__RadLabel__ is a themeable alternative to the standard Windows Forms label control. It allows you to include a label in your applications that is consistent in look and feel with the other Telerik UI for WinForms controls. The example below uses a custom theme that provides a slight shadow to the text, and a highlight when the mouse passes over the label.

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}
