# Creating a RadPanel with Rounded Corners

Built on the __Telerik Presentation Framework__, the __RadPanel__ control supports all features that come with it including gradient background colors, transparency and shapes.

The following steps describe how to apply a rounded rectangle shape to the __RadPanel__ control:

1. Add a __RadPanel__ control to your form

1. From its Smart Tag choose the *Edit UI Elements* action
