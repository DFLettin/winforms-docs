# Prevent the control from gaining focus

Currently, __RadCommandBar__ receives the focus. One can easily override this behavior and do not allow the control to become focused. Here are the three simple steps that need to be followed:
        

1. Create a custom class that derives from __RadCommandBar__;

1. Override the __ThemeClassName__ property, so that the theming mechanism can recognize the new control as a __RadCommandBar__;

1. Override the ProcessFocusRequested method and return false.
