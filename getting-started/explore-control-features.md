# Explore UI for WinForms Control Features
Once you have the controls [working in your project] ({%slug winforms/getting-started/first-steps%}), it's time to see what they can do. This article provides a short overview of how to get started with finding control functionality and use them.

## Demos
To access the **Live Demo** simply click on the Windows Start button and type WinForms Demo.
If you are not able to find the Live Demos using that approach you can also download it directly from [here](https://telerik-winforms-demos.s3.amazonaws.com/TelerikWinFormsExamplesLauncher.exe).
