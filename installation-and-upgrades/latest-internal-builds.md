Regular builds are an integral part of our development process and based on the continuous quality assurance and feedback, we strive to produce the most stable releases possible. If you have experienced any problem with the current official distributions there is a possibility that the issue has already been addressed in the latest internal build. 

Once you download the LIB version, it is necessary to [update the assemblies in your project]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/updating-assemblies-in-a-project%}).

>important IMPORTANT NOTE: The Latest Internal Builds are intended to be used for development purposes only and they are not recommended for production purposes as these distributions have not gone through the complete QA process.

## Installing LIB from NuGet

Latest Internal Builds are available for [installing as a NuGet package]({%slug winforms/nuget%}) as well:
