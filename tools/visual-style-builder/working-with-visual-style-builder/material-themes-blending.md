# Material Themes Blending

Telerik UI for WinForms suite offers a touch optimized theme which provides additional features such as custom fonts, built-in animations and shadows. We also have three other themes that are using the [Material]({%slug winforms/themes/touch-enabled-themes%}) theme as a foundation but have different colors:

* MaterialBlueGray
* MaterialPink
* MaterialTeal

## Generate Material Variation

[Visual Style Builder]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder%}) provides an easy way to generate different color variations of the **Material** theme. Material theme blending uses the basic Material theme by executing a series of predefined commands. 

Select *Tools >> Generate Material Variation* menu item:

>note If you already have loaded a customized Material theme (but not a Material variation) it will remain loaded when generating a Material variation.
This will open the **Material Blend Dialog** from which you can choose the **Primary color** and the **Accent color**:

If you click the **Generate theme** button, a new variation of the Material theme will be exported using the selected colors.

After loading the custom theme in [Theme Viewer]({%slug winforms/tools/themeviewer%}) the primary/accent colors are replaced:
