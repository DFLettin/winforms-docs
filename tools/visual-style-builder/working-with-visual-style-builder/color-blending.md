# Color Blending

## Overview

Visual Style Builder provides a color blending functionality making it easy to completely transform an existing theme. While preserving the overall look of the selected theme this feature allows you to define a new color, blend it with an existing one and at the end apply it to a single control or to all the controls from the suite. The pictures below shows the result after modifying the __TelerikMetro__ theme.
