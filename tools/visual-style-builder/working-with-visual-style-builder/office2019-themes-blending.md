# Office2019 Themes Blending

Telerik UI for WinForms suite offers a touch optimized theme which provides additional features such as custom fonts, built-in animations and shadows. The Visual Style Builder tool provides a functionality to blend the colors of an existing theme so that a completely new theme can be created for couple of minutes. We also have three different Office2019 themes that share the same design but have different colors:

 * **Office2019Light**
 * **Office2019Gray**
 * **Office2019Dark**

The Office2019 themes are designed to work with predefined set of colors. The tutorial here will demonstrate how a new **Office2019Light** theme can be created. The same steps can be also followed with the **Office2019Gray** and **Office2019Dark** themes.

## Generate Office2019 Variation

[Visual Style Builder]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder%}) provides an easy way to generate different color variations of the Office2019Light, Office2019Gray, and Office2019Light themes. Office2019Light theme blending uses the basic Office2019Light theme by executing a series of predefined commands.

Select *Tools >> Generate Office2019Light Variation* menu item:

>note If you already have loaded a customized Office2019Light theme (but not a Office2019Light variation) it will remain loaded when generating a Office2019Light variation. This will open the **Office2019 Blend Dialog** from which you can create a new palette or modify the selected one.

If you want to create a brand new palette you can click on the *Create New palette* button and it will open **New Palette Dialog**:

If you want to edit the existing pallete then click on the *Modify selected palette* button and it will open **Modify Palette Dialog**. You will be able to modify any of the existing colors:

When you are ready with picking colors for the palette you can click the **Generate theme** button. A new variation of the Office2019Light theme will be exported using the selected colors.

After loading the custom theme in [Theme Viewer]({%slug winforms/tools/themeviewer%}) the primary/accent colors are replaced:
