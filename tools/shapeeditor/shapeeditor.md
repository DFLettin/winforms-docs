# ShapeEditor

Each __RadElement__ / __RadItem__ can be shaped by setting the  __Shape__ property. The shape can be easily modified either in design mode or in  __Visual Style Builder__ by using the __Shape Designer__. The __Shape Designer__ provides an easy way for creating all kinds of custom shapes only by adding, removing and dragging the points which represent the shape. Each line can also be curved only by right-clicking and making it a curved line.
