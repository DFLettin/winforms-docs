# Adding and Removing Points

## Adding New Points

To add new points, right-click to select the line to which your new point will be added, and then click __Add Point__. This action places a point on the selected line equidistant from the endpoints of that line, creating two separate lines. You can now manipulate this new point as described in [Moving and Locking Points]({%slug winforms/tools/shapeeditor/using-the-custom-shape-editor/moving-and-locking-points%}).

## Removing Points

To remove an existing point, right-click to select the point, and then click __Delete__ from the [context menu]({%slug winforms/tools/shapeeditor/shape-editor-user-interface%}). This action will remove the point and the two connecting lines, and will replace them with a new line connecting the points adjacent to the one removed.
