# Toolbox Version

Telerik UI for WinForms controls used to be automatically added to Visual Studio's Toolbox during the [installation]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/adding-radcontrols-to-visual-studio-toolbox%}) process when using **.NET 2.0 (up to 4.8)** Framework in your project. This means that the Toolbox population relies on the Telerik WinForms version available in the Global Assembly Cache.

With the introduction of .NET Core/.NET 5 and the WinForms designer, the Toolbox configuration doesn't rely on the GAC anymore and it is not necessary to have an installation of the Telerik UI for WinForms suite. 

>important In order to enable the WinForms Designer, please get familiar with the requirements you need to meet: [Design Time]({%slug core-design-time%}).

The Toolbox version depends on the installed NuGet package:

>caption Toolbox version R3 2020 SP1 (2020.3.10.20)

If you want to get another version in the Toolbox, it is necessary to:

1\. Remove the current version of the **UI.for.WinForms.AllControls.NetCore** package:

2\. Install the desired NuGet version: [Install using NuGet Packages]({%slug winforms/nuget%})

3\. Rebuild the project.
