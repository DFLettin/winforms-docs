# Clipping

Clipping refers to leaving out certain areas of an element that fall outside of a specified clipping rectangle. Unlike WPF, which uses the arrange rectangle as the clipping rectangle, the Telerik Presentation Framework uses the parent rectangle. This means that only the area denoted by the rightmost thatched pattern is clipped. The area left visible is fully within the parent rectangle and is denoted by the thick light green line. Generally, the part of a child located outside of its parent bounds will be clipped if the __ClipDrawing__ property of the parent is set to true.

The diagram below shows a child with size greater than the size allocated for its display in order to show the clipping policy implemented by the Telerik Presentation Framework.
