# Design Time

To start using RadPrintDocument at design time, drag it from the toolbox and drop it on the form. It will appear as a component, so you can select it and edit its properties either through the `Property` window of Visual Studio, or by using its smart tag menu.

In the smart tag menu, you can associate the RadPrintDocument with an object that supports printing (i.e. which implements the __IPrintable__ interface) by choosing it from the __Printed Object__ drop-down. You can also setup the header and the footer of each page by setting a height value and a text for each part of the header/footer. If the __Reverse on Even Pages__ option is enabled, then the places of the __Left Text__ and the __Right Text__ will be swapped on pages with an even number.


To edit settings, specific for the selected printable object, click on the __Settings__	button in the smart tag menu. This will open the RadPrintSettingsDialog corresponding to the selected	printable object. You can use its full functionality to setup printing	settings at design time. More information about RadPrintSettingsDialog in [this article]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/end-user-functionality/print-settings-dialog%}).
