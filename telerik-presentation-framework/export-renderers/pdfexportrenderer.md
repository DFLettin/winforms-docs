# PdfExportRenderer

The __PdfExportRenderer__ class gives you access to the exported document and provides you with the ability to change it before it is saved.
        

The __PdfExportRenderer__ API gives you the ability to manipulate the document. The following two events are giving you the ability to make some final changes: 
        

* __PageExported:__ occurs when each page is exported. The __PageExportedEventArgs__ object gives you access to the [editor](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radpdfprocessing/editing/fixedcontenteditor) which you can use to paint on the page.
            

* __PdfExporting:__ occurs before the export process is completed. This event gives you access to the exported document and at this point you can manipulate it using the [PdfProcessing Library](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radpdfprocessing/overview)
