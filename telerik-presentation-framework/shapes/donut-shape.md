# Donut Shape

The following image shows the donut shape applied to a RadPanel:

![donut-shape001](images/donut-shape001.png)

The following code shows how you can create and apply a __DonutShape__:


{{source=..\SamplesCS\TPF\Shapes\ShapesCode.cs region=Donut}}  
{{source=..\SamplesVB\TPF\Shapes\ShapesCode.vb region=Donut}}
````C#
DonutShape donutShape = new DonutShape();
donutShape.Thickness = 50;
radPanel1.RootElement.Shape = donutShape;
radPanel1.RootElement.ApplyShapeToControl = true;

````
````VB.NET
Dim donutShape As New DonutShape()
donutShape.Thickness = 50
radPanel1.RootElement.Shape = donutShape
radPanel1.RootElement.ApplyShapeToControl = True

````  
 
{{endregion}} 

You can use the __Thickness__ property to adjust the donut width.
