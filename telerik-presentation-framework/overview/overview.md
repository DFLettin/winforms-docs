The Telerik Presentation Framework (TPF) offers WPF-like features within classic Windows Forms applications. 

* All controls have access to common services provided by TPF such as theming, animation, and property binding. 

* No matter how complex a control may be, a control is built up from a few simple types of elements. By working with these elements, you can customize any control on a very granular level. 


* All elements in a control element tree inherit common property values from their parent elements unless these values are set locally. This feature helps each element use less memory while still providing fine-grained customization options. 

The uniform nature of the [control architecture]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/class-hierarchy/class-hierarchy-overview%}) makes it possible to nest controls within each other for more flexible and modern user interfaces.
