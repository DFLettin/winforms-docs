# Handling User Input

Mouse and keyboard user input is accepted from Windows event notification in __RadControl__, but actually handled in __RadElement__ and __RadItem__ objects.
        
* __RadControl__ is the object that is first notified of Windows events, i.e. mouse over, key press, etc., and calls corresponding methods of __RadElement__ through the RadControl __RadRootElement__ property.

* __RadElement__ introduces methods for dispatching user input information. This information is acted on if the RadElement __ShouldHandleMouseInput__ property is *true*. By default, __ShouldHandleMouseInput__ is set false and must be turned on explicitly. The __NotifyParentOnMouseInput__ property is introduced in RadElement to control the [bubbling]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/events/routed-events%}) of mouse events to parent elements. By default __NotifyParentOnMouseInput__ is *false*.

* __RadItem.ShouldHandleMouseInput__ is true by default. RadItem also introduces keyboard methods and events including __KeyDown__, __KeyPress__ and __KeyUp__ events.

The diagram below shows the inheritance tree where the __RootRadElement__ descends from __RadItem__, and where __RadItem__ ultimately descends from __RadElement__:
